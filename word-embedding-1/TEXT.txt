A CASE FOR DEVELOPING DOMAIN-SPECIFIC VOCABULARIES FOR EXTRACTING SUICIDE FACTORS FROM HEALTHCARE NOTES. THE ONSET AND PERSISTENCE OF LIFE EVENTS (LE) SUCH AS HOUSING INSTABILITY, JOB INSTABILITY, AND REDUCED SOCIAL CONNECTION HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO INCREASE RISK OF SUICIDE. PREDICTIVE MODELS FOR SUICIDE RISK HAVE LOW SENSITIVITY TO MANY OF THESE FACTORS DUE TO UNDER-REPORTING IN STRUCTURED ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS (EHR) DATA. IN THIS STUDY, WE SHOW HOW NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) CAN HELP IDENTIFY LE IN CLINICAL NOTES AT HIGHER RATES THAN REPORTED MEDICAL CODES. WE COMPARE DOMAIN-SPECIFIC LEXICONS FORMULATED FROM UNIFIED MEDICAL LANGUAGE SYSTEM (UMLS) SELECTION, CONTENT ANALYSIS BY SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS (SME) AND THE GRAVITY PROJECT, TO DATA-DRIVEN EXPANSION THROUGH CONTEXTUAL WORD EMBEDDING USING WORD2VEC. OUR ANALYSIS COVERS EHR FROM THE VETERANS AFFAIRS (VA) CORPORATE DATA WAREHOUSE (CDW) AND MEASURES THE PREVALENCE OF LE ACROSS TIME FOR PATIENTS WITH KNOWN UNDERLYING CAUSE OF DEATH IN THE NATIONAL DEATH INDEX (NDI). WE FOUND THAT NLP METHODS HAD HIGHER SENSITIVITY OF DETECTING LE RELATIVE TO STRUCTURED EHR (S-EHR) VARIABLES. WE OBSERVED THAT, ON AVERAGE, SUICIDE CASES HAD HIGHER RATES OF LE OVER TIME WHEN COMPARED TO PATIENTS WHO DIED OF NON-SUICIDE RELATED CAUSES WITH NO PREVIOUS HISTORY OF DIAGNOSED MENTAL ILLNESS. WHEN USED TO DISCRIMINATE THESE OUTCOMES, THE INCLUSION OF NLP DERIVED VARIABLES INCREASED THE CONCENTRATION OF LE ALONG THE TOP 0.1%, 0.5% AND 1% OF PREDICTED RISK. LE WERE LESS INFORMATIVE WHEN DISCRIMINATING SUICIDE DEATH FROM NON-SUICIDE RELATED DEATH FOR PATIENTS WITH DIAGNOSED MENTAL ILLNESS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS ON QUESTION CLASSIFICATION TASK BASED ON DEEP LEARNING APPROACHES. QUESTION CLASSIFICATION IS ONE OF THE ESSENTIAL TASKS FOR AUTOMATIC QUESTION ANSWERING IMPLEMENTATION IN NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP). RECENTLY, THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL TEXT-MINING ISSUES SUCH AS TEXT CLASSIFICATION, DOCUMENT CATEGORIZATION, WEB MINING, SENTIMENT ANALYSIS, AND SPAM FILTERING THAT HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY ACHIEVED BY DEEP LEARNING APPROACHES. IN THIS STUDY, WE ILLUSTRATED AND INVESTIGATED OUR WORK ON CERTAIN DEEP LEARNING APPROACHES FOR QUESTION CLASSIFICATION TASKS IN AN EXTREMELY INFLECTED TURKISH LANGUAGE. IN THIS STUDY, WE TRAINED AND TESTED THE DEEP LEARNING ARCHITECTURES ON THE QUESTIONS DATASET IN TURKISH. IN ADDITION TO THIS, WE USED THREE MAIN DEEP LEARNING APPROACHES (GATED RECURRENT UNIT (GRU), LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY (LSTM), CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS (CNN)) AND WE ALSO APPLIED TWO DIFFERENT DEEP LEARNING COMBINATIONS OF CNN-GRU AND CNN-LSTM ARCHITECTURES. FURTHERMORE, WE APPLIED THE WORD2VEC TECHNIQUE WITH BOTH SKIP-GRAM AND CBOW METHODS FOR WORD EMBEDDING WITH VARIOUS VECTOR SIZES ON A LARGE CORPUS COMPOSED OF USER QUESTIONS. BY COMPARING ANALYSIS, WE CONDUCTED AN EXPERIMENT ON DEEP LEARNING ARCHITECTURES BASED ON TEST AND 10-CROSS FOLD VALIDATION ACCURACY. EXPERIMENT RESULTS WERE OBTAINED TO ILLUSTRATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF VARIOUS WORD2VEC TECHNIQUES THAT HAVE A CONSIDERABLE IMPACT ON THE ACCURACY RATE USING DIFFERENT DEEP LEARNING APPROACHES. WE ATTAINED AN ACCURACY OF 93.7% BY USING THESE TECHNIQUES ON THE QUESTION DATASET.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
A COMPARATIVE EVALUATION OF BIOMEDICAL SIMILAR ARTICLE RECOMMENDATION. BACKGROUND: BIOMEDICAL SCIENCES, WITH THEIR FOCUS ON HUMAN HEALTH AND DISEASE, HAVE ATTRACTED UNPRECEDENTED ATTENTION IN THE 21ST CENTURY. THE PROLIFERATION OF BIOMEDICAL SCIENCES HAS ALSO LED TO A LARGE NUMBER OF SCIENTIFIC ARTICLES BEING PRODUCED, WHICH MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR BIOMEDICAL RESEARCHERS TO FIND RELEVANT ARTICLES AND HINDERS THE DISSEMINATION OF VALUABLE DISCOVERIES. TO BRIDGE THIS GAP, THE RESEARCH COMMUNITY HAS INITIATED THE ARTICLE RECOMMENDATION TASK, WITH THE AIM OF RECOMMENDING ARTICLES TO BIOMEDICAL RESEARCHERS AUTOMATICALLY BASED ON THEIR RESEARCH INTERESTS. OVER THE PAST TWO DECADES, MANY RECOMMENDATION METHODS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED. HOWEVER, AN ALGORITHM-LEVEL COMPARISON AND RIGOROUS EVALUATION OF THE MOST IMPORTANT METHODS ON A SHARED DATASET IS STILL LACKING. METHOD: IN THIS STUDY, WE FIRST INVESTIGATE 15 METHODS FOR AUTOMATED ARTICLE RECOMMENDATION IN THE BIOMEDICAL DOMAIN. WE THEN CONDUCT AN EMPIRICAL EVALUATION OF THE 15 METHODS, INCLUDING SIX TERM-BASED METHODS, TWO WORD EMBEDDING METHODS, THREE SENTENCE EMBEDDING METHODS, TWO DOCUMENT EMBEDDING METHODS, AND TWO BERT-BASED METHODS. THESE METHODS ARE EVALUATED IN TWO SCENARIOS: ARTICLE-ORIENTED RECOMMENDERS AND USER-ORIENTED RECOMMENDERS, WITH TWO PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATASETS: TREC 2005 GENOMICS AND RELISH, RESPECTIVELY. RESULTS: OUR EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS SHOW THAT THE TEXT REPRESENTATION MODELS BERT AND BIOSENVEC OUTPERFORM MANY EXISTING RECOMMENDATION METHODS (E.G., BM25, PMRA, XPRC) AND WEB-BASED RECOMMENDATION SYSTEMS (E.G., MSCANNER, MEDLINERANKER, BIOREADER) ON BOTH DATASETS REGARDING MOST OF THE EVALUATION METRICS, AND FINE-TUNING CAN IMPROVE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE BERT-BASED METHODS. CONCLUSIONS: OUR COMPARISON STUDY IS USEFUL FOR RESEARCHERS AND PRACTITIONERS IN SELECTING THE BEST MODELING STRATEGIES FOR BUILDING ARTICLE RECOMMENDATION SYSTEMS IN THE BIOMEDICAL DOMAIN. THE CODE AND DATASETS ARE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
A COMPARATIVE STUDY ON DEEP LEARNING MODELS FOR TEXT CLASSIFICATION OF UNSTRUCTURED MEDICAL NOTES WITH VARIOUS LEVELS OF CLASS IMBALANCE. BACKGROUND: DISCHARGE MEDICAL NOTES WRITTEN BY PHYSICIANS CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE HEALTH CONDITION OF PATIENTS. MANY DEEP LEARNING ALGORITHMS HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY APPLIED TO EXTRACT IMPORTANT INFORMATION FROM UNSTRUCTURED MEDICAL NOTES DATA THAT CAN ENTAIL SUBSEQUENT ACTIONABLE RESULTS IN THE MEDICAL DOMAIN. THIS STUDY AIMS TO EXPLORE THE MODEL PERFORMANCE OF VARIOUS DEEP LEARNING ALGORITHMS IN TEXT CLASSIFICATION TASKS ON MEDICAL NOTES WITH RESPECT TO DIFFERENT DISEASE CLASS IMBALANCE SCENARIOS. METHODS: IN THIS STUDY, WE EMPLOYED SEVEN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE MODELS, A CNN (CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK), A TRANSFORMER ENCODER, A PRETRAINED BERT (BIDIRECTIONAL ENCODER REPRESENTATIONS FROM TRANSFORMERS), AND FOUR TYPICAL SEQUENCE NEURAL NETWORKS MODELS, NAMELY, RNN (RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORK), GRU (GATED RECURRENT UNIT), LSTM (LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY), AND BI-LSTM (BI-DIRECTIONAL LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY) TO CLASSIFY THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF 16 DISEASE CONDITIONS FROM PATIENTS' DISCHARGE SUMMARY NOTES. WE ANALYZED THIS QUESTION AS A COMPOSITION OF 16 BINARY SEPARATE CLASSIFICATION PROBLEMS. THE MODEL PERFORMANCE OF THE SEVEN MODELS ON EACH OF THE 16 DATASETS WITH VARIOUS LEVELS OF IMBALANCE BETWEEN CLASSES WERE COMPARED IN TERMS OF AUC-ROC (AREA UNDER THE CURVE OF THE RECEIVER OPERATING CHARACTERISTIC), AUC-PR (AREA UNDER THE CURVE OF PRECISION AND RECALL), F1 SCORE, AND BALANCED ACCURACY AS WELL AS THE TRAINING TIME. THE MODEL PERFORMANCES WERE ALSO COMPARED IN COMBINATION WITH DIFFERENT WORD EMBEDDING APPROACHES (GLOVE, BIOWORDVEC, AND NO PRE-TRAINED WORD EMBEDDINGS). RESULTS: THE ANALYSES OF THESE 16 BINARY CLASSIFICATION PROBLEMS SHOWED THAT THE TRANSFORMER ENCODER MODEL PERFORMS THE BEST IN NEARLY ALL SCENARIOS. IN ADDITION, WHEN THE DISEASE PREVALENCE IS CLOSE TO OR GREATER THAN 50%, THE CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK MODEL ACHIEVED A COMPARABLE PERFORMANCE TO THE TRANSFORMER ENCODER, AND ITS TRAINING TIME WAS 17.6% SHORTER THAN THE SECOND FASTEST MODEL, 91.3% SHORTER THAN THE TRANSFORMER ENCODER, AND 94.7% SHORTER THAN THE PRE-TRAINED BERT-BASE MODEL. THE BIOWORDVEC EMBEDDINGS SLIGHTLY IMPROVED THE PERFORMANCE OF THE BI-LSTM MODEL IN MOST DISEASE PREVALENCE SCENARIOS, WHILE THE CNN MODEL PERFORMED BETTER WITHOUT PRE-TRAINED WORD EMBEDDINGS. IN ADDITION, THE TRAINING TIME WAS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED WITH THE GLOVE EMBEDDINGS FOR ALL MODELS. CONCLUSIONS: FOR CLASSIFICATION TASKS ON MEDICAL NOTES, TRANSFORMER ENCODERS ARE THE BEST CHOICE IF THE COMPUTATION RESOURCE IS NOT AN ISSUE. OTHERWISE, WHEN THE CLASSES ARE RELATIVELY BALANCED, CNNS ARE A LEADING CANDIDATE BECAUSE OF THEIR COMPETITIVE PERFORMANCE AND COMPUTATIONAL EFFICIENCY.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
A COMPARISON OF WORD EMBEDDINGS TO STUDY COMPLICATIONS IN NEUROSURGERY. OUR STUDY AIMED TO COMPARE THE CAPABILITY OF DIFFERENT WORD EMBEDDINGS TO CAPTURE THE SEMANTIC SIMILARITY OF CLINICAL CONCEPTS RELATED TO COMPLICATIONS IN NEUROSURGERY AT THE LEVEL OF MEDICAL EXPERTS. EIGHTY-FOUR SETS OF WORD EMBEDDINGS (BASED ON WORD2VEC, GLOVE, FASTTEXT, PMI, AND BERT ALGORITHMS) WERE BENCHMARKED IN A CLUSTERING TASK. FASTTEXT MODEL SHOWED THE BEST CLOSE TO THE MEDICAL EXPERTISE CAPABILITY TO GROUP MEDICAL TERMS BY THEIR MEANING (ADJUSTED RAND INDEX = 0.682). WORD EMBEDDING MODELS CAN ACCURATELY REFLECT CLINICAL CONCEPTS' SEMANTIC AND LINGUISTIC SIMILARITIES, PROMISING THEIR ROBUST USAGE IN MEDICAL DOMAIN-SPECIFIC NLP TASKS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
A COMPUTATIONAL THEORY FOR THE EMERGENCE OF GRAMMATICAL CATEGORIES IN CORTICAL DYNAMICS. A GENERAL AGREEMENT IN PSYCHOLINGUISTICS CLAIMS THAT SYNTAX AND MEANING ARE UNIFIED PRECISELY AND VERY QUICKLY DURING ONLINE SENTENCE PROCESSING. ALTHOUGH SEVERAL THEORIES HAVE ADVANCED ARGUMENTS REGARDING THE NEUROCOMPUTATIONAL BASES OF THIS PHENOMENON, WE ARGUE THAT THESE THEORIES COULD POTENTIALLY BENEFIT BY INCLUDING NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL DATA CONCERNING CORTICAL DYNAMICS CONSTRAINTS IN BRAIN TISSUE. IN ADDITION, SOME THEORIES PROMOTE THE INTEGRATION OF COMPLEX OPTIMIZATION METHODS IN NEURAL TISSUE. IN THIS PAPER WE ATTEMPT TO FILL THESE GAPS INTRODUCING A COMPUTATIONAL MODEL INSPIRED IN THE DYNAMICS OF CORTICAL TISSUE. IN OUR MODELING APPROACH, PROXIMAL AFFERENT DENDRITES PRODUCE STOCHASTIC CELLULAR ACTIVATIONS, WHILE DISTAL DENDRITIC BRANCHES-ON THE OTHER HAND-CONTRIBUTE INDEPENDENTLY TO SOMATIC DEPOLARIZATION BY MEANS OF DENDRITIC SPIKES, AND FINALLY, PREDICTION FAILURES PRODUCE MASSIVE FIRING EVENTS PREVENTING FORMATION OF SPARSE DISTRIBUTED REPRESENTATIONS. THE MODEL PRESENTED IN THIS PAPER COMBINES SEMANTIC AND COARSE-GRAINED SYNTACTIC CONSTRAINTS FOR EACH WORD IN A SENTENCE CONTEXT UNTIL GRAMMATICALLY RELATED WORD FUNCTION DISCRIMINATION EMERGES SPONTANEOUSLY BY THE SOLE CORRELATION OF LEXICAL INFORMATION FROM DIFFERENT SOURCES WITHOUT APPLYING COMPLEX OPTIMIZATION METHODS. BY MEANS OF SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE TECHNIQUES, WE SHOW THAT THE SPARSE ACTIVATION FEATURES RETURNED BY OUR APPROACH ARE WELL SUITED-BOOTSTRAPPING FROM THE FEATURES RETURNED BY WORD EMBEDDING MECHANISMS-TO ACCOMPLISH GRAMMATICAL FUNCTION CLASSIFICATION OF INDIVIDUAL WORDS IN A SENTENCE. IN THIS WAY WE DEVELOP A BIOLOGICALLY GUIDED COMPUTATIONAL EXPLANATION FOR LINGUISTICALLY RELEVANT UNIFICATION PROCESSES IN CORTEX WHICH CONNECTS PSYCHOLINGUISTICS TO NEUROBIOLOGICAL ACCOUNTS OF LANGUAGE. WE ALSO CLAIM THAT THE COMPUTATIONAL HYPOTHESES ESTABLISHED IN THIS RESEARCH COULD FOSTER FUTURE WORK ON BIOLOGICALLY-INSPIRED LEARNING ALGORITHMS FOR NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING APPLICATIONS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
A CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK-BASED LINGUISTIC STEGANALYSIS FOR SYNONYM SUBSTITUTION STEGANOGRAPHY. IN THIS PAPER, A LINGUISTIC STEGANALYSIS METHOD BASED ON TWO-LEVEL CASCADED CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS (CNNS) IS PROPOSED TO IMPROVE THE SYSTEM'S ABILITY TO DETECT STEGO TEXTS, WHICH ARE GENERATED VIA SYNONYM SUBSTITUTIONS. THE FIRST-LEVEL NETWORK, SENTENCE-LEVEL CNN, CONSISTS OF ONE CONVOLUTIONAL LAYER WITH MULTIPLE CONVOLUTIONAL KERNELS IN DIFFERENT WINDOW SIZES, ONE POOLING LAYER TO DEAL WITH VARIABLE SENTENCE LENGTHS, AND ONE FULLY CONNECTED LAYER WITH DROPOUT AS WELL AS A SOFTMAX OUTPUT, SUCH THAT TWO FINAL STEGANOGRAPHIC FEATURES ARE OBTAINED FOR EACH SENTENCE. THE UNMODIFIED AND MODIFIED SENTENCES, ALONG WITH THEIR WORDS, ARE REPRESENTED IN THE FORM OF PRE-TRAINED DENSE WORD EMBEDDINGS, WHICH SERVE AS THE INPUT OF THE NETWORK. SENTENCE-LEVEL CNN PROVIDES THE REPRESENTATION OF A SENTENCE, AND CAN THUS BE UTILIZED TO PREDICT WHETHER A SENTENCE IS UNMODIFIED OR HAS BEEN MODIFIED BY SYNONYM SUBSTITUTIONS. IN THE SECOND LEVEL, A TEXT-LEVEL CNN EXPLOITS THE PREDICTED REPRESENTATIONS OF SENTENCES OBTAINED FROM THE SENTENCE-LEVEL CNN TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE DETECTED TEXT IS A STEGO TEXT OR COVER TEXT. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE PROPOSED SENTENCE-LEVEL CNN CAN EFFECTIVELY EXTRACT SENTENCE FEATURES FOR SENTENCE-LEVEL STEGANALYSIS TASKS AND REACHES AN AVERAGE ACCURACY OF 82.245%. MOREOVER, THE PROPOSED STEGANALYSIS METHOD ACHIEVES GREATLY IMPROVED DETECTION PERFORMANCE WHEN DISTINGUISHING STEGO TEXTS FROM COVER TEXTS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
A CORE DRUG DISCOVERY FRAMEWORK FROM LARGE-SCALE LITERATURE FOR COLD PATHOGENIC DISEASE TREATMENT IN TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE. COLD PATHOGENIC DISEASE IS A WIDESPREAD DISEASE IN TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE, WHICH INCLUDES INFLUENZA AND RESPIRATORY INFECTION ASSOCIATED WITH HIGH INCIDENCE AND MORTALITY. DISCOVERING EFFECTIVE CORE DRUGS IN CHINESE MEDICINE PRESCRIPTIONS FOR TREATING THE DISEASE AND REDUCING PATIENTS' SYMPTOMS HAS ATTRACTED GREAT INTEREST. IN THIS PAPER, WE EXPLORE THE CORE DRUGS FOR CURING VARIOUS SYNDROMES OF COLD PATHOGENIC DISEASE FROM LARGE-SCALE LITERATURE. WE PROPOSE A CORE DRUG DISCOVERY FRAMEWORK INCORPORATING WORD EMBEDDING AND COMMUNITY DETECTION ALGORITHMS, WHICH CONTAINS THREE PARTS: DISEASE CORPUS CONSTRUCTION, DRUG NETWORK GENERATION, AND CORE DRUG DISCOVERY. FIRST, DISEASE CORPUS IS ESTABLISHED BY COLLECTING AND PREPROCESSING LARGE-SCALE LITERATURE ABOUT THE CHINESE MEDICINE TREATMENT OF COLD PATHOGENIC DISEASE FROM CHINA NATIONAL KNOWLEDGE INFRASTRUCTURE. SECOND, WE ADOPT THE CHINESE WORD EMBEDDING MODEL SSP2VEC FOR MINING THE DRUG IMPLICATION IMPLIED IN THE LITERATURE; THEN, A DRUG NETWORK IS ESTABLISHED BY THE SEMANTIC SIMILARITY AMONG DRUGS. THIRD, THE COMMUNITY DETECTION METHOD COPRA BASED ON LABEL PROPAGATION IS ADOPTED TO REVEAL DRUG COMMUNITIES AND IDENTIFY CORE DRUGS IN THE DRUG NETWORK. WE COMPUTE THE COMMUNITY SIZE, CLOSENESS CENTRALITY, AND DEGREE DISTRIBUTIONS OF THE DRUG NETWORK TO ANALYSE THE PATTERNS OF CORE DRUGS. WE ACQUIRE 4681 LITERATURE FROM CHINA NATIONAL KNOWLEDGE INFRASTRUCTURE. TWELVE SIGNIFICANT DRUG COMMUNITIES ARE DISCOVERED, IN WHICH THE TOP-10 DRUGS IN EVERY DRUG COMMUNITY ARE RECOGNIZED AS CORE DRUGS WITH HIGH ACCURACY, AND FOUR CLASSICAL PRESCRIPTIONS FOR TREATING DIFFERENT SYNDROMES OF COLD PATHOGENIC DISEASE ARE DISCOVERED. THE PROPOSED FRAMEWORK CAN IDENTIFY EFFECTIVE CORE DRUGS FOR CURING COLD PATHOGENIC DISEASE, AND THE RESEARCH CAN HELP DOCTORS TO VERIFY THE COMPATIBILITY LAWS OF CHINESE MEDICINE PRESCRIPTIONS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
A DATA-DRIVEN INTELLIGENT SYSTEM FOR ASSISTIVE DESIGN OF INTERIOR ENVIRONMENTS. THIS PAPER ANALYSES THE DESIGN OF A HEALTHY INTERIOR ENVIRONMENT USING BIG DATA INTELLIGENCE. THE APPLICATION OF BIG DATA INTELLIGENCE IN THE DESIGN OF HEALTHY INTERIOR ENVIRONMENTS IS NECESSARY BECAUSE THE TRADITIONAL INTERIOR DESIGN APPROACHES CONSUME A LOT OF ENERGY AND OTHER PROBLEMS. BENEFITED BY ITS STRONG ABILITY OF COMPUTATION AND ANALYTICS, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE CAN WELL IMPROVE A SERIES OF PROBLEMS IN THE FIELD OF INTERIOR DESIGN. THE PROPOSAL SUMMARIZES THE SOURCES, CLASSIFICATIONS, AND EXPRESSIONS OF BEHAVIORAL DATA IN INTERIOR SPACES, CARRIES OUT ANALYSIS AND RESEARCH ON BEHAVIORAL DATA FROM TWO ASPECTS: DISPLAY SPACE AND SUPERMARKET SPACE, SUMMARIZES THE INTERIOR METHODS BASED ON BEHAVIORAL DATA, AND ANALYSES THE VISUALIZATION APPLICATION OF BEHAVIORAL DATA IN DIFFERENT INTERIOR SCENES, TO EXPLORE THE APPLICATION VALUE OF BEHAVIORAL DATA IN INTERIOR DESIGN. IN CONTRAST TO IT IS THE UNCONSCIOUS BEHAVIORAL RESPONSE, THE BIGGEST CHARACTERISTIC OF WHICH IS THAT IT IS REGULATED BY THE BEHAVIORAL SUBJECT'S PHYSIOLOGICAL FACTORS OR HABITS OF THE BEHAVIOR ISSUER. IN THIS PAPER, WE CONVERT THE LAYOUT RECOMMENDATION PROBLEM OF A SPACE INTO A FUNCTIONAL CLASSIFICATION PROBLEM OF SEGMENTED SEGMENTS AND HOUSEHOLD SEGMENTS ON A PLANE. THE SCENE LAYOUT FEATURES ARE EXTRACTED BY BINARY CODING, THE ABSTRACTION OF THE CROSS FEATURES BETWEEN THE VECTOR SEGMENTS IS ACHIEVED BY USING A WORD EMBEDDING ALGORITHM, THE FEATURE MATRIX IS REDUCED IN DIMENSIONALITY, AND FINALLY, THE SEGMENTATION NETWORK MODEL AND THE LAYOUT NETWORK MODEL ARE CONSTRUCTED, RESPECTIVELY, BY USING A BIDIRECTIONAL LSTM. THE EXPERIMENTS SHOW THAT THE ACCURACY OF THE LAYOUT RECOMMENDATION MODEL IN THIS PAPER IS 98%, WHICH CAN MEET THE DEMAND FOR REAL-TIME ONLINE LAYOUTS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
A DEEP LEARNING APPROACH IN PREDICTING PRODUCTS' SENTIMENT RATINGS: A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS. WE PRESENT A BENCHMARK COMPARISON OF SEVERAL DEEP LEARNING MODELS INCLUDING CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS, RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORK AND BI-DIRECTIONAL LONG SHORT TERM MEMORY, ASSESSED BASED ON VARIOUS WORD EMBEDDING APPROACHES, INCLUDING THE BI-DIRECTIONAL ENCODER REPRESENTATIONS FROM TRANSFORMERS (BERT) AND ITS VARIANTS, FASTTEXT AND WORD2VEC. DATA AUGMENTATION WAS ADMINISTERED USING THE EASY DATA AUGMENTATION APPROACH RESULTING IN TWO DATASETS (ORIGINAL VERSUS AUGMENTED). ALL THE MODELS WERE ASSESSED IN TWO SETUPS, NAMELY 5-CLASS VERSUS 3-CLASS (I.E., COMPRESSED VERSION). FINDINGS SHOW THE BEST PREDICTION MODELS WERE NEURAL NETWORK-BASED USING WORD2VEC, WITH CNN-RNN-BI-LSTM PRODUCING THE HIGHEST ACCURACY (96%) AND F-SCORE (91.1%). INDIVIDUALLY, RNN WAS THE BEST MODEL WITH AN ACCURACY OF 87.5% AND F-SCORE OF 83.5%, WHILE ROBERTA HAD THE BEST F-SCORE OF 73.1%. THE STUDY SHOWS THAT DEEP LEARNING IS BETTER FOR ANALYZING THE SENTIMENTS WITHIN THE TEXT COMPARED TO SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING AND PROVIDES A DIRECTION FOR FUTURE WORK AND RESEARCH.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
A DEEP LEARNING FRAMEWORK COMBINED WITH WORD EMBEDDING TO IDENTIFY DNA REPLICATION ORIGINS. THE DNA REPLICATION INFLUENCES THE INHERITANCE OF GENETIC INFORMATION IN THE DNA LIFE CYCLE. AS THE DISTRIBUTION OF REPLICATION ORIGINS (ORIS) IS THE MAJOR DETERMINANT TO PRECISELY REGULATE THE REPLICATION PROCESS, THE CORRECT IDENTIFICATION OF ORIS IS SIGNIFICANT IN GIVING AN INSIGHTFUL UNDERSTANDING OF DNA REPLICATION MECHANISMS AND THE REGULATORY MECHANISMS OF GENETIC EXPRESSIONS. FOR EUKARYOTES IN PARTICULAR, MULTIPLE ORIS EXIST IN EACH OF THEIR GENE SEQUENCES TO COMPLETE THE REPLICATION IN A REASONABLE PERIOD OF TIME. TO SIMPLIFY THE IDENTIFICATION PROCESS OF EUKARYOTE'S ORIS, MOST OF EXISTING METHODS ARE DEVELOPED BY TRADITIONAL MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS, AND TARGET TO THE GENE SEQUENCES WITH A FIXED LENGTH. CONSEQUENTLY, THE IDENTIFICATION RESULTS ARE NOT SATISFYING, I.E. THERE IS STILL GREAT ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT. TO BREAK THROUGH THE LIMITATIONS IN PREVIOUS STUDIES, THIS PAPER DEVELOPS SEQUENCE SEGMENTATION METHODS, AND EMPLOYS THE WORD EMBEDDING TECHNIQUE, 'WORD2VEC', TO CONVERT GENE SEQUENCES INTO WORD VECTORS, THEREBY GRASPING THE INNER CORRELATIONS OF GENE SEQUENCES WITH DIFFERENT LENGTHS. THEN, A DEEP LEARNING FRAMEWORK TO PERFORM THE ORI IDENTIFICATION TASK IS CONSTRUCTED BY A CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK WITH AN EMBEDDING LAYER. ON THE BASIS OF THE ANALYSIS OF SIMILARITY REDUCTION DIMENSIONALITY DIAGRAM, WORD2VEC CAN EFFECTIVELY TRANSFORM THE INNER RELATIONSHIP AMONG WORDS INTO NUMERICAL FEATURE. FOR FOUR SPECIES IN THIS STUDY, THE BEST MODELS ARE OBTAINED WITH THE OVERALL ACCURACY OF 0.975, 0.765, 0.885, 0.967, THE MATTHEW'S CORRELATION COEFFICIENT OF 0.940, 0.530, 0.771, 0.934, AND THE AUC OF 0.975, 0.800, 0.888, 0.981, WHICH INDICATE THAT THE PROPOSED PREDICTOR HAS A STABLE ABILITY AND PROVIDE A HIGH CONFIDENCE COEFFICIENT TO CLASSIFY BOTH OF ORIS AND NON-ORIS. COMPARED WITH STATE-OF-THE-ART METHODS, THE PROPOSED PREDICTOR CAN ACHIEVE ORI IDENTIFICATION WITH SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT. IT IS THEREFORE REASONABLE TO ANTICIPATE THAT THE PROPOSED METHOD WILL MAKE A USEFUL HIGH THROUGHPUT TOOL FOR GENOME ANALYSIS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
A DEEP LEARNING FRAMEWORK FOR ENHANCER PREDICTION USING WORD EMBEDDING AND SEQUENCE GENERATION. ENHANCERS ARE NON-CODING DAN FRAGMENTS THAT PLAY KEY ROLES IN GENE REGULATIONS AND CAN PROMOTE THE TRANSCRIPTION OF STRUCTURAL GENES, THEREBY AFFECTING THE EXPRESSION OF STRUCTURAL PROTEIN CATALYTIC ENZYMES AND REGULATORY PROTEINS. ACCURATE IDENTIFICATION OF ENHANCERS HELPS TO UNDERSTAND THE TRANSCRIPTION OF STRUCTURAL GENES AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF HUMAN TUMORIGENESIS, DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT. THE ENHANCER SEQUENCES HAVE HIGH POSITION VARIATIONS AND DISPERSIONS, AND THE IDENTIFICATION OF ENHANCERS IS MORE CHALLENGING THAN OTHER GENETIC FACTORS. BASED ON WORD EMBEDDING AND SEQUENCE GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORKS, A DEEP LEARNING FRAMEWORK FOR ENHANCER IDENTIFICATION IS PROPOSED. FIRSTLY, CONSIDERING THE SMALL NUMBER OF SEQUENCES IN THE BENCHMARK DATASET, RANKGAN IS USED TO AMPLIFY THE DATASET SIZE WHILE MAINTAINING THE DATA CHARACTERISTICS. THEN, IN VIEW OF THE SIMILARITY BETWEEN DNA SEQUENCE AND NATURAL LANGUAGE, DNA SEQUENCE IS REGARDED AS A SENTENCE COMPOSED OF MULTIPLE "WORDS", AND THE WORD EMBEDDING TECHNOLOGY FASTTEXT IS APPLIED TO TRANSFORM IT INTO A NUMERICAL MATRIX. TO EXTRACT THE DEPENDENCIES AND HIGHLY ABSTRACT FEATURES OF NUCLEOTIDES IN DNA SEQUENCES, A LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (LSTM-CNN) IS CONSTRUCTED TO PERFORM THE IDENTIFICATION TASK. ON THE INDEPENDENT TEST SET, THE ACCURACY AND MATTHEW'S CORRELATION COEFFICIENT (MCC) FOR ENHANCER PREDICTION ARE 0.7525 AND 0.5051, RESPECTIVELY. FOR THE ENHANCER TYPE PREDICTION, THE ACCURACY AND MCC OF THIS METHOD ARE 0.6972 AND 0.3954, RESPECTIVELY. COMPARED WITH EXISTING METHODS, THIS METHOD ACHIEVES MORE SATISFACTORY RESULTS FOR THE PREDICTION OF ENHANCERS AND THEIR TYPES. THIS STUDY WILL FURTHER ENRICH THE APPLICATION OF NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING IN BIOINFORMATICS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
A DEEP LEARNING-BASED METHOD FOR SIMILAR PATIENT QUESTION RETRIEVAL IN CHINESE. THE ONLINE PATIENT QUESTION AND ANSWERING (Q&AMP;A) SYSTEM, EITHER AS A WEBSITE OR A MOBILE APPLICATION, ATTRACTS AN INCREASING NUMBER OF USERS IN CHINA. PATIENTS WILL POST THEIR QUESTIONS AND THE REGISTERED DOCTORS THEN PROVIDE THE CORRESPONDING ANSWERS. A LARGE AMOUNT OF QUESTIONS WITH ANSWERS FROM DOCTORS ARE ACCUMULATED. INSTEAD OF AWAITING THE RESPONSE FROM A DOCTOR, THE NEWLY POSTED QUESTION COULD BE QUICKLY ANSWERED BY FINDING A SEMANTICALLY EQUIVALENT QUESTION FROM THE Q&AMP;A ACHIVE. IN THIS STUDY, WE INVESTIGATED A NOVEL DEEP LEARNING BASED METHOD TO RETRIEVE THE SIMILAR PATIENT QUESTION IN CHINESE. AN UNSUPERVISED LEARNING ALGORITHM USING DEEP NEURAL NETWORK IS PERFORMED ON THE CORPUS TO GENERATE THE WORD EMBEDDING. THE WORD EMBEDDING WAS THEN USED AS THE INPUT TO A SUPERVISED LEARNING ALGORITHM USING A DESIGNED DEEP NEURAL NETWORK, I.E. THE SUPERVISED NEURAL ATTENTION MODEL (SNA), TO PREDICT THE SIMILARITY BETWEEN TWO QUESTIONS. THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS SHOWED THAT OUR SNA METHOD ACHIEVED P@1 = 77% AND P@5 = 84%, WHICH OUTPERFORMED ALL OTHER COMPARED METHODS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
A DISTANT SUPERVISION BASED APPROACH TO MEDICAL PERSONA CLASSIFICATION. IDENTIFYING MEDICAL PERSONA FROM A SOCIAL MEDIA POST IS CRITICAL FOR DRUG MARKETING, PHARMACOVIGILANCE AND PATIENT RECRUITMENT. MEDICAL PERSONA CLASSIFICATION AIMS TO COMPUTATIONALLY MODEL THE MEDICAL PERSONA ASSOCIATED WITH A SOCIAL MEDIA POST. WE PRESENT A NOVEL DEEP LEARNING MODEL FOR THIS TASK WHICH CONSISTS OF TWO PARTS: CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS (CNNS), WHICH EXTRACT HIGHLY RELEVANT FEATURES FROM THE SENTENCES OF A SOCIAL MEDIA POST AND AVERAGE POOLING, WHICH AGGREGATES THE SENTENCE EMBEDDINGS TO OBTAIN TASK-SPECIFIC DOCUMENT EMBEDDING. WE COMPARE OUR APPROACH AGAINST STANDARD BASELINES, SUCH AS TERM FREQUENCY - INVERSE DOCUMENT FREQUENCY (TF-IDF), AVERAGED WORD EMBEDDING BASED METHODS AND POPULAR NEURAL ARCHITECTURES, SUCH AS CNN-LONG SHORT TERM MEMORY (CNN-LSTM) AND HIERARCHICAL ATTENTION NETWORKS (HANS). OUR MODEL ACHIEVES AN IMPROVEMENT OF 19.7% FOR CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY AND 20.1% FOR MICRO F1 MEASURE OVER THE CURRENT STATE-OF-THE-ART. WE ELIMINATE THE NEED FOR MANUAL LABELING BY EMPLOYING A DISTANT SUPERVISION BASED METHOD TO OBTAIN LABELED EXAMPLES FOR TRAINING THE MODELS. WE THOROUGHLY ANALYZE OUR MODEL TO DISCOVER CUES THAT ARE INDICATIVE OF A PARTICULAR PERSONA. PARTICULARLY, WE USE FIRST DERIVATIVE SALIENCY TO IDENTIFY THE SALIENT WORDS IN A PARTICULAR SOCIAL MEDIA POST.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
A GENE-PHENOTYPE RELATIONSHIP EXTRACTION PIPELINE FROM THE BIOMEDICAL LITERATURE USING A REPRESENTATION LEARNING APPROACH. MOTIVATION: THE FUNDAMENTAL CHALLENGE OF MODERN GENETIC ANALYSIS IS TO ESTABLISH GENE-PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS THAT ARE OFTEN FOUND IN THE LARGE-SCALE PUBLICATIONS. BECAUSE LEXICAL FEATURES OF GENE ARE RELATIVELY REGULAR IN TEXT, THE MAIN CHALLENGE OF THESE RELATION EXTRACTION IS PHENOTYPE RECOGNITION. DUE TO PHENOTYPIC DESCRIPTIONS ARE OFTEN STUDY- OR AUTHOR-SPECIFIC, FEW LEXICON CAN BE USED TO EFFECTIVELY IDENTIFY THE ENTIRE PHENOTYPIC EXPRESSIONS IN TEXT, ESPECIALLY FOR PLANTS. RESULTS: WE HAVE PROPOSED A PIPELINE FOR EXTRACTING PHENOTYPE, GENE AND THEIR RELATIONS FROM BIOMEDICAL LITERATURE. COMBINED WITH ABBREVIATION REVISION AND SENTENCE TEMPLATE EXTRACTION, WE IMPROVED THE UNSUPERVISED WORD-EMBEDDING-TO-SENTENCE-EMBEDDING CASCADED APPROACH AS REPRESENTATION LEARNING TO RECOGNIZE THE VARIOUS BROAD PHENOTYPIC INFORMATION IN LITERATURE. IN ADDITION, THE DICTIONARY- AND RULE-BASED METHOD WAS APPLIED FOR GENE RECOGNITION. FINALLY, WE INTEGRATED ONE OF FAMOUS INFORMATION EXTRACTION SYSTEM OLLIE TO IDENTIFY GENE-PHENOTYPE RELATIONS. TO DEMONSTRATE THE APPLICABILITY OF THE PIPELINE, WE ESTABLISHED TWO TYPES OF COMPARISON EXPERIMENT USING MODEL ORGANISM ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA. IN THE COMPARISON OF STATE-OF-THE-ART BASELINES, OUR APPROACH OBTAINED THE BEST PERFORMANCE (F1-MEASURE OF 66.83%). WE ALSO APPLIED THE PIPELINE TO 481 FULL-ARTICLES FROM TAIR GENE-PHENOTYPE MANUAL RELATIONSHIP DATASET TO PROVE THE VALIDITY. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT OUR PROPOSED PIPELINE CAN COVER 70.94% OF THE ORIGINAL DATASET AND ADD 373 NEW RELATIONS TO EXPAND IT.

A HYBRID CHINESE WORD SEGMENTATION MODEL FOR QUALITY MANAGEMENT-RELATED TEXTS BASED ON TRANSFER LEARNING. TEXT INFORMATION MINING IS A KEY STEP TO DATA-DRIVEN AUTOMATIC/SEMI-AUTOMATIC QUALITY MANAGEMENT (QM). FOR CHINESE TEXTS, A WORD SEGMENTATION ALGORITHM IS NECESSARY FOR PRE-PROCESSING SINCE THERE ARE NO EXPLICIT MARKS TO DEFINE WORD BOUNDARIES. BECAUSE OF INTRINSIC CHARACTERISTICS OF QM-RELATED TEXTS, WORD SEGMENTATION ALGORITHMS FOR NORMAL CHINESE TEXTS CANNOT BE DIRECTLY APPLIED. HENCE, BASED ON THE ANALYSIS OF QM-RELATED TEXTS, WE SUMMARIZED SIX FEATURES, AND PROPOSED A HYBRID CHINESE WORD SEGMENTATION MODEL BY MEANS OF INTEGRATING TRANSFER LEARNING (TL), BIDIRECTIONAL LONG-SHORT TERM MEMORY (BI-LSTM), MULTI-HEAD ATTENTION (MA), AND CONDITIONAL RANDOM FIELD (CRF) TO CONSTRUCT THE MTL-BI-LSTM-MA-CRF MODEL, CONSIDERING INSUFFICIENT SAMPLES OF QM-RELATED TEXTS AND EXCESSIVE CUTTING OF IDIOMS. THE MTL-BI-LSTM-MA-CRF MODEL IS COMPOSED OF TWO STEPS. FIRSTLY, BASED ON A WORD EMBEDDING SPACE, THE BI-LSTM IS INTRODUCED FOR CONTEXT INFORMATION LEARNING, AND THE MA MECHANISM IS SELECTED TO ALLOCATE ATTENTION AMONG SUBSPACES, AND THEN THE CRF IS USED TO LEARN LABEL SEQUENCE CONSTRAINTS. SECONDLY, A MODIFIED TL METHOD IS PUT FORWARD FOR TEXT FEATURE EXTRACTION, ADAPTIVE LAYER WEIGHTS LEARNING, AND LOSS FUNCTION CORRECTION FOR SELECTIVE LEARNING. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS SHOW THAT THE PROPOSED MODEL CAN ACHIEVE GOOD WORD SEGMENTATION RESULTS WITH ONLY A RELATIVELY SMALL SET OF SAMPLES.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
A HYBRID MODEL TO IDENTIFY FALL OCCURRENCE FROM ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS. INTRODUCTION: FALLS ARE A LEADING CAUSE OF UNINTENTIONAL INJURY IN THE ELDERLY. ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS (EHRS) OFFER THE UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO DEVELOP MODELS THAT CAN IDENTIFY FALL EVENTS. HOWEVER, IDENTIFYING FALL EVENTS IN CLINICAL NOTES REQUIRES ADVANCED NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) TO SIMULTANEOUSLY ADDRESS MULTIPLE ISSUES BECAUSE THE WORD "FALL" IS A TYPICAL HOMONYM. METHODS: WE IMPLEMENTED A CONTEXT-AWARE LANGUAGE MODEL, BIDIRECTIONAL ENCODER REPRESENTATIONS FROM TRANSFORMERS (BERT) TO IDENTIFY FALLS FROM THE EHR TEXT AND FURTHER FUSED THE BERT MODEL INTO A HYBRID ARCHITECTURE COUPLED WITH POST-HOC HEURISTIC RULES TO ENHANCE THE PERFORMANCE. THE MODELS WERE EVALUATED ON REAL WORLD EHR DATA AND WERE COMPARED TO CONVENTIONAL RULE-BASED AND DEEP LEARNING MODELS (CNN AND BI-LSTM). TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE ABILITY OF EACH APPROACH TO IDENTIFY FALLS, WE FURTHER CATEGORIZE FALL-RELATED CONCEPTS (I.E., RISK OF FALL, PREVENTION OF FALL, HOMONYM) AND PERFORMED A DETAILED ERROR ANALYSIS. RESULTS: THE HYBRID MODEL ACHIEVED THE HIGHEST F1-SCORE ON SENTENCE (0.971), DOCUMENT (0.985), AND PATIENT (0.954) LEVEL. AT THE SENTENCE LEVEL (BASIC DATA UNIT IN THE MODEL), THE HYBRID MODEL HAD 0.954, 1.000, 0.988, AND 0.999 IN SENSITIVITY, SPECIFICITY, POSITIVE PREDICTIVE VALUE, AND NEGATIVE PREDICTIVE VALUE, RESPECTIVELY. THE ERROR ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT THAT MACHINE LEARNING-BASED APPROACHES DEMONSTRATED HIGHER PERFORMANCE THAN A RULE-BASED APPROACH IN CHALLENGING CASES THAT REQUIRED CONTEXTUAL UNDERSTANDING. THE CONTEXT-AWARE LANGUAGE MODEL (BERT) SLIGHTLY OUTPERFORMED THE WORD EMBEDDING APPROACH TRAINED ON BI-LSTM. NO SINGLE MODEL YIELDED THE BEST PERFORMANCE FOR ALL FALL-RELATED SEMANTIC CATEGORIES. CONCLUSION: A CONTEXT-AWARE LANGUAGE MODEL (BERT) WAS ABLE TO IDENTIFY CHALLENGING FALL EVENTS THAT REQUIRES CONTEXT UNDERSTANDING IN EHR FREE TEXT. THE HYBRID MODEL COMBINED WITH POST-HOC RULES ALLOWED A CUSTOM FIX ON THE BERT OUTCOMES AND FURTHER IMPROVED THE PERFORMANCE OF FALL DETECTION.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
A METHOD OF INFERRING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BIOMEDICAL ENTITIES THROUGH CORRELATION ANALYSIS ON TEXT. BACKGROUND: ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PROCESSES IN A MACHINE LEARNING-BASED NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING IS TO REPRESENT WORDS. THE ONE-HOT REPRESENTATION THAT HAS BEEN COMMONLY USED HAS A LARGE SIZE OF VECTOR AND ASSUMES THAT THE FEATURES THAT MAKE UP THE VECTOR ARE INDEPENDENT OF EACH OTHER. ON THE OTHER HAND, IT IS KNOWN THAT WORD EMBEDDING HAS A GREAT EFFECT IN ESTIMATING THE SIMILARITY BETWEEN WORDS BECAUSE IT EXPRESSES THE MEANING OF THE WORD WELL. IN THIS STUDY, WE TRY TO CLARIFY THE CORRELATION BETWEEN VARIOUS TERMS IN THE BIOMEDICAL TEXTS BASED ON THE EXCELLENT ABILITY OF ESTIMATING SIMILARITY BETWEEN WORDS SHOWN BY WORD EMBEDDING. THEREFORE, WE USED WORD EMBEDDING TO FIND NEW BIOMARKERS AND MICROORGANISMS RELATED TO A SPECIFIC DISEASES. METHODS: IN THIS STUDY, WE TRY TO ANALYZE THE CORRELATION BETWEEN DISEASES-MARKERS AND DISEASES-MICROORGANISMS. FIRST, WE NEED TO CONSTRUCT A CORPUS THAT SEEMS TO BE RELATED TO THEM. TO DO THIS, WE EXTRACT THE TITLES AND ABSTRACTS FROM THE BIOMEDICAL TEXTS ON THE PUBMED SITE. SECOND, WE EXPRESS DISEASES, MARKERS, AND MICROORGANISMS' TERMS IN WORD EMBEDDING USING CANONICAL CORRELATION ANALYSIS (CCA). CCA IS A STATISTICAL BASED METHODOLOGY THAT HAS A VERY GOOD PERFORMANCE ON VECTOR DIMENSION REDUCTION. FINALLY, WE TRIED TO ESTIMATE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DISEASES-MARKERS PAIRS AND DISEASES-MICROORGANISMS PAIRS BY MEASURING THEIR SIMILARITY. RESULTS: IN THE EXPERIMENT, WE TRIED TO CONFIRM THE CORRELATION DERIVED THROUGH WORD EMBEDDING USING GOOGLE SCHOLAR SEARCH RESULTS. OF THE TOP 20 HIGHLY CORRELATED DISEASE-MARKER PAIRS, ABOUT 85% OF THE PAIRS HAVE ACTUALLY UNDERGONE A LOT OF RESEARCH AS A RESULT OF GOOGLE SCHOLARS SEARCH. CONVERSELY, FOR 85% OF THE 20 PAIRS WITH THE LOWEST CORRELATION, WE COULD NOT ACTUALLY FIND ANY OTHER STUDY TO DETERMINE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE DISEASE AND THE MARKER. THIS TREND WAS SIMILAR FOR DISEASE-MICROBE PAIRS. CONCLUSIONS: THE CORRELATION BETWEEN DISEASES AND MARKERS AND DISEASES AND MICROORGANISMS CALCULATED THROUGH WORD EMBEDDING REFLECTS ACTUAL RESEARCH TRENDS. IF THE WORD-EMBEDDING CORRELATION IS HIGH, BUT THERE ARE NOT MANY PUBLISHED ACTUAL STUDIES, ADDITIONAL RESEARCH CAN BE PROPOSED FOR THE PAIR.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
A METHOD OF SHORT TEXT REPRESENTATION BASED ON THE FEATURE PROBABILITY EMBEDDED VECTOR. TEXT REPRESENTATION IS ONE OF THE KEY TASKS IN THE FIELD OF NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP). TRADITIONAL FEATURE EXTRACTION AND WEIGHTING METHODS OFTEN USE THE BAG-OF-WORDS (BOW) MODEL, WHICH MAY LEAD TO A LACK OF SEMANTIC INFORMATION AS WELL AS THE PROBLEMS OF HIGH DIMENSIONALITY AND HIGH SPARSITY. AT PRESENT, TO SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS, A POPULAR IDEA IS TO UTILIZE DEEP LEARNING METHODS. IN THIS PAPER, FEATURE WEIGHTING, WORD EMBEDDING, AND TOPIC MODELS ARE COMBINED TO PROPOSE AN UNSUPERVISED TEXT REPRESENTATION METHOD NAMED THE FEATURE, PROBABILITY, AND WORD EMBEDDING METHOD. THE MAIN IDEA IS TO USE THE WORD EMBEDDING TECHNOLOGY WORD2VEC TO OBTAIN THE WORD VECTOR, AND THEN COMBINE THIS WITH THE FEATURE WEIGHTED TF-IDF AND THE TOPIC MODEL LDA. COMPARED WITH TRADITIONAL FEATURE ENGINEERING, THE PROPOSED METHOD NOT ONLY INCREASES THE EXPRESSIVE ABILITY OF THE VECTOR SPACE MODEL, BUT ALSO REDUCES THE DIMENSIONS OF THE DOCUMENT VECTOR. BESIDES THIS, IT CAN BE USED TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS OF THE INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION, HIGH DIMENSIONS, AND HIGH SPARSITY OF BOW. WE USE THE PROPOSED METHOD FOR THE TASK OF TEXT CATEGORIZATION AND VERIFY THE VALIDITY OF THE METHOD.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
A MICROARRAY ANALYSIS TECHNIQUE USING A SELF-ORGANIZING MULTIAGENT APPROACH. MICROARRAY TECHNOLOGY IS FULLY ESTABLISHED AMONG THE RESEARCH FIELDS IN GENETIC DOMAIN. ACADEMIA AND INDUSTRIAL RESEARCHERS INVESTIGATE AND ANALYZE GENES' EXPRESSION TO OBTAIN MORE AND MORE USEFUL INFORMATION ABOUT GIVEN ORGANISMS, WITH THE AIM TO PERFORM BETTER DISEASE DIAGNOSIS AND PREDICTION, ACCURATE MEDICAL DATA ANALYSIS, ETC. ANALYZING GENE EXPRESSION DATA, OFTEN AVAILABLE IN RAW FORM, IMPLIES A HUGE AMOUNT OF ANALYTICAL AND COMPUTATIONAL COMPLEXITIES AND THEREFORE, INNOVATIVE AND INTELLIGENT MECHANISMS HAVE TO BE DESIGNED TO OBTAIN USEFUL INFORMATION FROM THIS PRECIOUS DATA. THIS CHAPTER PROPOSES A MULTIAGENT ALGORITHM FOR BUILDING A DISTRIBUTED ALGORITHM FOR DNA MICROARRAY MANAGEMENT. A COLLECTION OF AGENTS, IN WHICH EACH ONE REPRESENTING A MICROARRAY (OR CHIP), EXECUTE IN PARALLEL A SEQUENCE OF SIMPLE OPERATIONS EXPLOITING LOCAL INFORMATION, AND AN ORGANIZED VIRTUAL STRUCTURE IS BUILT AT GLOBAL LEVEL. A WORD EMBEDDINGS APPROACH, ABLE TO CAPTURE THE SEMANTIC CONTEXT AND REPRESENT MICROARRAYS WITH VECTORS, IS EMPLOYED TO MAP THE CHIPS, SO ALLOWING ADVANCED AGENTS' OPERATIONS. A SIMILARITY-BASED OVERLAY NETWORK OF AGENTS IS BROUGHT OUT AND AN EFFICIENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM OF DNA MICROARRAY IS ENABLED. THE GENERATED VIRTUAL STRUCTURE ALLOWS EXECUTING OF INFORMED OPERATIONS, SUCH AS RANGE QUERIES, IN A LARGE DATASET CONTAINING UNSTRUCTURED DATA. PRELIMINARY RESULTS WERE CONFIRM THE VALIDITY OF THE ALGORITHM PROPOSED.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
A MIRNA TARGET PREDICTION MODEL BASED ON DISTRIBUTED REPRESENTATION LEARNING AND DEEP LEARNING. MICRORNAS (MIRNAS) ARE A KIND OF NONCODING RNA, WHICH PLAYS AN ESSENTIAL ROLE IN GENE REGULATION BY BINDING TO MESSENGER RNAS (MRNAS). ACCURATE AND RAPID IDENTIFICATION OF MIRNA TARGET GENES IS HELPFUL TO REVEAL THE MECHANISM OF TRANSCRIPTOME REGULATION, WHICH IS OF GREAT SIGNIFICANCE FOR THE STUDY OF CANCER AND OTHER DISEASES. MANY BIOINFORMATICS METHODS HAVE BEEN PROPOSED TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM, BUT THE PREVIOUS RESEARCH DID NOT FURTHER STUDY THE ENCODING OF THE NUCLEOTIDE SEQUENCE. IN THIS PAPER, WE DEVELOPED A NOVEL METHOD COMBINING WORD EMBEDDING AND DEEP LEARNING FOR HUMAN MIRNA TARGETS AT THE SITE-LEVEL PREDICTION, WHICH IS INSPIRED BY THE SIMILARITY BETWEEN NATURAL LANGUAGE AND BIOLOGICAL SEQUENCES. FIRST, THE WORD2VEC MODEL WAS USED TO MINE THE DISTRIBUTION REPRESENTATION OF MIRNAS AND MRNAS. THEN, THE EMBEDDING IS EXTRACTED AUTOMATICALLY VIA THE STACKED BIDIRECTIONAL LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY (BILSTM) NETWORK. BY TESTING, OUR METHOD CAN EFFECTIVELY IMPROVE THE ACCURACY, SENSITIVITY, SPECIFICITY, AND F-MEASURE OF OTHER METHODS. THROUGH OUR RESEARCH, IT IS PROVED THAT THE DISTRIBUTED REPRESENTATION CAN IMPROVE THE ACCURACY OF THE DEEP LEARNING MODEL AND BETTER SOLVE THE MIRNA TARGET SITE PREDICTION PROBLEM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
A MULTIPLE DISTRIBUTED REPRESENTATION METHOD BASED ON NEURAL NETWORK FOR BIOMEDICAL EVENT EXTRACTION. BACKGROUND: BIOMEDICAL EVENT EXTRACTION IS ONE OF THE MOST FRONTIER DOMAINS IN BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH. THE TWO MAIN SUBTASKS OF BIOMEDICAL EVENT EXTRACTION ARE TRIGGER IDENTIFICATION AND ARGUMENTS DETECTION WHICH CAN BOTH BE CONSIDERED AS CLASSIFICATION PROBLEMS. HOWEVER, TRADITIONAL STATE-OF-THE-ART METHODS ARE BASED ON SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE (SVM) WITH MASSIVE MANUALLY DESIGNED ONE-HOT REPRESENTED FEATURES, WHICH REQUIRE ENORMOUS WORK BUT LACK SEMANTIC RELATION AMONG WORDS. METHODS: IN THIS PAPER, WE PROPOSE A MULTIPLE DISTRIBUTED REPRESENTATION METHOD FOR BIOMEDICAL EVENT EXTRACTION. THE METHOD COMBINES CONTEXT CONSISTING OF DEPENDENCY-BASED WORD EMBEDDING, AND TASK-BASED FEATURES REPRESENTED IN A DISTRIBUTED WAY AS THE INPUT OF DEEP LEARNING MODELS TO TRAIN DEEP LEARNING MODELS. FINALLY, WE USED SOFTMAX CLASSIFIER TO LABEL THE EXAMPLE CANDIDATES. RESULTS: THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS ON MULTI-LEVEL EVENT EXTRACTION (MLEE) CORPUS SHOW HIGHER F-SCORES OF 77.97% IN TRIGGER IDENTIFICATION AND 58.31% IN OVERALL COMPARED TO THE STATE-OF-THE-ART SVM METHOD. CONCLUSIONS: OUR DISTRIBUTED REPRESENTATION METHOD FOR BIOMEDICAL EVENT EXTRACTION AVOIDS THE PROBLEMS OF SEMANTIC GAP AND DIMENSION DISASTER FROM TRADITIONAL ONE-HOT REPRESENTATION METHODS. THE PROMISING RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT OUR PROPOSED METHOD IS EFFECTIVE FOR BIOMEDICAL EVENT EXTRACTION.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
A MULTITASK BI-DIRECTIONAL RNN MODEL FOR NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION ON CHINESE ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS. BACKGROUND: ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORD (EMR) COMPRISES PATIENTS' MEDICAL INFORMATION GATHERED BY MEDICAL STUFF FOR PROVIDING BETTER HEALTH CARE. NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION (NER) IS A SUB-FIELD OF INFORMATION EXTRACTION AIMED AT IDENTIFYING SPECIFIC ENTITY TERMS SUCH AS DISEASE, TEST, SYMPTOM, GENES ETC. NER CAN BE A RELIEF FOR HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS AND MEDICAL SPECIALISTS TO EXTRACT USEFUL INFORMATION AUTOMATICALLY AND AVOID UNNECESSARY AND UNRELATED INFORMATION IN EMR. HOWEVER, LIMITED RESOURCES OF AVAILABLE EMR POSE A GREAT CHALLENGE FOR MINING ENTITY TERMS. THEREFORE, A MULTITASK BI-DIRECTIONAL RNN MODEL IS PROPOSED HERE AS A POTENTIAL SOLUTION OF DATA AUGMENTATION TO ENHANCE NER PERFORMANCE WITH LIMITED DATA. METHODS: A MULTITASK BI-DIRECTIONAL RNN MODEL IS PROPOSED FOR EXTRACTING ENTITY TERMS FROM CHINESE EMR. THE PROPOSED MODEL CAN BE DIVIDED INTO A SHARED LAYER AND A TASK SPECIFIC LAYER. FIRSTLY, VECTOR REPRESENTATION OF EACH WORD IS OBTAINED AS A CONCATENATION OF WORD EMBEDDING AND CHARACTER EMBEDDING. THEN BI-DIRECTIONAL RNN IS USED TO EXTRACT CONTEXT INFORMATION FROM SENTENCE. AFTER THAT, ALL THESE LAYERS ARE SHARED BY TWO DIFFERENT TASK LAYERS, NAMELY THE PARTS-OF-SPEECH TAGGING TASK LAYER AND THE NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION TASK LAYER. THESE TWO TASKS LAYERS ARE TRAINED ALTERNATIVELY SO THAT THE KNOWLEDGE LEARNED FROM NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION TASK CAN BE ENHANCED BY THE KNOWLEDGE GAINED FROM PARTS-OF-SPEECH TAGGING TASK. RESULTS: THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR PROPOSED MODEL HAS BEEN EVALUATED IN TERMS OF MICRO AVERAGE F-SCORE, MACRO AVERAGE F-SCORE AND ACCURACY. IT IS OBSERVED THAT THE PROPOSED MODEL OUTPERFORMS THE BASELINE MODEL IN ALL CASES. FOR INSTANCE, EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS CONDUCTED ON THE DISCHARGE SUMMARIES SHOW THAT THE MICRO AVERAGE F-SCORE AND THE MACRO AVERAGE F-SCORE ARE IMPROVED BY 2.41% POINT AND 4.16% POINT, RESPECTIVELY, AND THE OVERALL ACCURACY IS IMPROVED BY 5.66% POINT. CONCLUSIONS: IN THIS PAPER, A NOVEL MULTITASK BI-DIRECTIONAL RNN MODEL IS PROPOSED FOR IMPROVING THE PERFORMANCE OF NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION IN EMR.

A NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) EVALUATION ON COVID-19 RUMOUR DATASET USING DEEP LEARNING TECHNIQUES. CONTEXT AND BACKGROUND: SINCE DECEMBER 2019, THE CORONAVIRUS (COVID-19) EPIDEMIC HAS SPARKED CONSIDERABLE ALARM AMONG THE GENERAL COMMUNITY AND SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED SOCIETAL ATTITUDES AND PERCEPTIONS. APART FROM THE DISEASE ITSELF, MANY PEOPLE SUFFER FROM ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION DUE TO THE DISEASE AND THE PRESENT THREAT OF AN OUTBREAK. DUE TO THE FAST PROPAGATION OF THE VIRUS AND MISLEADING/FAKE INFORMATION, THE ISSUES OF PUBLIC DISCOURSE ALTER, RESULTING IN SIGNIFICANT CONFUSION IN CERTAIN PLACES. RUMOURS ARE UNPROVEN FACTS OR STORIES THAT PROPAGATE AND PROMOTE SENTIMENTS OF PREJUDICE, HATRED, AND FEAR. OBJECTIVE. THE STUDY'S OBJECTIVE IS TO PROPOSE A NOVEL SOLUTION TO DETECT FAKE NEWS USING STATE-OF-THE-ART MACHINES AND DEEP LEARNING MODELS. FURTHERMORE, TO ANALYSE WHICH MODELS OUTPERFORMED IN DETECTING THE FAKE NEWS. METHOD. IN THE RESEARCH STUDY, WE ADAPTED A COVID-19 RUMOURS DATASET, WHICH INCORPORATES RUMOURS FROM NEWS WEBSITES AND TWEETS, TOGETHER WITH INFORMATION ABOUT THE RUMOURS. IT IS IMPORTANT TO ANALYSE DATA UTILIZING NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) AND DEEP LEARNING (DL) APPROACHES. BASED ON THE ACCURACY, PRECISION, RECALL, AND THE F1 SCORE, WE CAN ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE ML AND DL ALGORITHMS. RESULTS. THE DATA ADOPTED FROM THE SOURCE (MENTIONED IN THE PAPER) HAVE COLLECTED 9200 COMMENTS FROM GOOGLE AND 34,779 TWITTER POSTINGS FILTERED FOR PHRASES CONNECTED WITH COVID-19-RELATED FAKE NEWS. EXPERIMENT 1. THE DATASET WAS ASSESSED USING THE FOLLOWING THREE CRITERIA: VERACITY, STANCE, AND SENTIMENT. IN THESE TERMS, WE HAVE DIFFERENT LABELS, AND WE HAVE APPLIED THE DL ALGORITHMS SEPARATELY TO EACH TERM. WE HAVE USED DIFFERENT MODELS IN THE EXPERIMENT SUCH AS (I) LSTM AND (II) TEMPORAL CONVOLUTION NETWORKS (TCN). THE TCN MODEL HAS MORE PERFORMANCE ON EACH MEASUREMENT PARAMETER IN THE EVALUATED RESULTS. SO, WE HAVE USED THE TCN MODEL FOR THE PRACTICAL IMPLICATION FOR BETTER FINDINGS. EXPERIMENT 2. IN THE SECOND EXPERIMENT, WE HAVE USED DIFFERENT STATE-OF-THE-ART DEEP LEARNING MODELS AND ALGORITHMS SUCH AS (I) SIMPLE RNN; (II) LSTM + WORD EMBEDDING; (III) BIDIRECTIONAL + WORD EMBEDDING; (IV) LSTM + CNN-1D; AND (V) BERT. FURTHERMORE, WE HAVE EVALUATED THE PERFORMANCE OF THESE MODELS ON ALL THREE DATASETS, E.G., VERACITY, STANCE, AND SENTIMENT. BASED ON OUR SECOND EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION, THE BERT HAS A SUPERIOR PERFORMANCE OVER THE OTHER MODELS COMPARED.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
A NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING APPROACH BASED ON EMBEDDING DEEP LEARNING FROM HETEROGENEOUS COMPOUNDS FOR QUANTITATIVE STRUCTURE-ACTIVITY RELATIONSHIP MODELING. OVER THE PAST DECADE, RAPID DEVELOPMENT IN BIOLOGICAL AND CHEMICAL TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS HIGH-THROUGHPUT SCREENING, PARALLEL SYNTHESIS, HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THE AMOUNT OF DATA, WHICH REQUIRES THE CREATION AND THE INTEGRATION OF NEW ANALYTICAL METHODS, ESPECIALLY DEEP LEARNING MODELS. RECENTLY, THERE IS AN INCREASING INTEREST IN DEEP LEARNING UTILIZATION IN COMPUTER-AIDED DRUG DISCOVERY DUE TO ITS EXCEPTIONAL SUCCESSFUL APPLICATION IN MANY FIELDS. THE PRESENT WORK PROPOSED A NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING APPROACH, BASED ON EMBEDDING DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS. OUR METHOD AIMS TO TRANSFORM THE SIMPLIFIED MOLECULAR INPUT LINE ENTRY SYSTEM FORMAT INTO WORD EMBEDDING VECTORS TO REPRESENT THE SEMANTICS OF COMPOUNDS. THESE VECTORS ARE FED INTO SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS SUCH AS CONVOLUTIONAL LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY NEURAL NETWORK, SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE, AND RANDOM FOREST TO BUILD UP QUANTITATIVE STRUCTURE-ACTIVITY RELATIONSHIP MODELS ON TOXICITY DATA SETS. THE OBTAINED RESULTS ON TOXICITY DATA TO THE CILIATE TETRAHYMENA PYRIFORMIS (IGC50 ), AND ACUTE TOXICITY RAT DATA EXPRESSED AS MEDIAN LETHAL DOSE OF TREATED RATS (LD50 ) SHOW THAT OUR APPROACH CAN EVENTUALLY BE USED TO PREDICT THE ACTIVITIES OF CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS EFFICIENTLY.

A NEW DATA REPRESENTATION BASED ON TRAINING DATA CHARACTERISTICS TO EXTRACT DRUG NAME ENTITY IN MEDICAL TEXT. ONE ESSENTIAL TASK IN INFORMATION EXTRACTION FROM THE MEDICAL CORPUS IS DRUG NAME RECOGNITION. COMPARED WITH TEXT SOURCES COME FROM OTHER DOMAINS, THE MEDICAL TEXT MINING POSES MORE CHALLENGES, FOR EXAMPLE, MORE UNSTRUCTURED TEXT, THE FAST GROWING OF NEW TERMS ADDITION, A WIDE RANGE OF NAME VARIATION FOR THE SAME DRUG, THE LACK OF LABELED DATASET SOURCES AND EXTERNAL KNOWLEDGE, AND THE MULTIPLE TOKEN REPRESENTATIONS FOR A SINGLE DRUG NAME. ALTHOUGH MANY APPROACHES HAVE BEEN PROPOSED TO OVERWHELM THE TASK, SOME PROBLEMS REMAINED WITH POOR F-SCORE PERFORMANCE (LESS THAN 0.75). THIS PAPER PRESENTS A NEW TREATMENT IN DATA REPRESENTATION TECHNIQUES TO OVERCOME SOME OF THOSE CHALLENGES. WE PROPOSE THREE DATA REPRESENTATION TECHNIQUES BASED ON THE CHARACTERISTICS OF WORD DISTRIBUTION AND WORD SIMILARITIES AS A RESULT OF WORD EMBEDDING TRAINING. THE FIRST TECHNIQUE IS EVALUATED WITH THE STANDARD NN MODEL, THAT IS, MLP. THE SECOND TECHNIQUE INVOLVES TWO DEEP NETWORK CLASSIFIERS, THAT IS, DBN AND SAE. THE THIRD TECHNIQUE REPRESENTS THE SENTENCE AS A SEQUENCE THAT IS EVALUATED WITH A RECURRENT NN MODEL, THAT IS, LSTM. IN EXTRACTING THE DRUG NAME ENTITIES, THE THIRD TECHNIQUE GIVES THE BEST F-SCORE PERFORMANCE COMPARED TO THE STATE OF THE ART, WITH ITS AVERAGE F-SCORE BEING 0.8645.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
A NEW METHOD OF SOFTWARE VULNERABILITY DETECTION BASED ON A QUANTUM NEURAL NETWORK. IN THE FIELD OF NETWORK SECURITY, ALTHOUGH THERE HAS BEEN RELATED WORK ON SOFTWARE VULNERABILITY DETECTION BASED ON CLASSIC MACHINE LEARNING, DETECTION ABILITY IS DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL TO THE SCALE OF TRAINING DATA. A QUANTUM NEURAL NETWORK HAS BEEN PROVEN TO SOLVE THE MEMORY BOTTLENECK PROBLEM OF CLASSICAL MACHINE LEARNING, SO IT HAS FAR-REACHING PROSPECTS IN THE FIELD OF VULNERABILITY DETECTION. TO FILL THE GAP IN THIS FIELD, WE PROPOSE A QUANTUM NEURAL NETWORK STRUCTURE NAMED QDENN FOR SOFTWARE VULNERABILITY DETECTION. THIS WORK IS THE FIRST ATTEMPT TO IMPLEMENT WORD EMBEDDING OF VULNERABILITY CODES BASED ON A QUANTUM NEURAL NETWORK, WHICH PROVES THE FEASIBILITY OF A QUANTUM NEURAL NETWORK IN THE FIELD OF VULNERABILITY DETECTION. EXPERIMENTS DEMONSTRATE THAT OUR PROPOSED QDENN CAN EFFECTIVELY SOLVE THE INCONSISTENT INPUT LENGTH PROBLEM OF QUANTUM NEURAL NETWORKS AND THE PROBLEM OF BATCH PROCESSING WITH LONG SENTENCES. FURTHERMORE, IT CAN GIVE FULL PLAY TO THE ADVANTAGES OF QUANTUM COMPUTING AND REALIZE A VULNERABILITY DETECTION MODEL AT THE COST OF A SMALL AMOUNT OF MEASUREMENT. COMPARED TO OTHER QUANTUM NEURAL NETWORKS, OUR PROPOSED QDENN CAN ACHIEVE HIGHER VULNERABILITY DETECTION ACCURACY. ON THE SUB DATASET WITH A SMALL-SCALE INTERVAL, THE MODEL ACCURACY RATE REACHES 99%. ON EACH SUBINTERVAL DATA, THE BEST AVERAGE VULNERABILITY DETECTION ACCURACY OF THE MODEL REACHES 86.3%.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
A NOVEL CIRCRNA-MIRNA ASSOCIATION PREDICTION MODEL BASED ON STRUCTURAL DEEP NEURAL NETWORK EMBEDDING. A LARGE AMOUNT OF CLINICAL EVIDENCE BEGAN TO MOUNT, SHOWING THAT CIRCULAR RIBONUCLEIC ACIDS (RNAS; CIRCRNAS) PERFORM A VERY IMPORTANT FUNCTION IN COMPLEX DISEASES BY PARTICIPATING IN TRANSCRIPTION AND TRANSLATION REGULATION OF MICRORNA (MIRNA) TARGET GENES. HOWEVER, WITH STRICT HIGH-THROUGHPUT TECHNIQUES BASED ON TRADITIONAL BIOLOGICAL EXPERIMENTS AND THE CONDITIONS AND ENVIRONMENT, THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN CIRCRNA AND MIRNA CAN BE DISCOVERED TO BE LABOR-INTENSIVE, EXPENSIVE, TIME-CONSUMING, AND INEFFICIENT. IN THIS PAPER, WE PROPOSED A NOVEL COMPUTATIONAL MODEL BASED ON WORD2VEC, STRUCTURAL DEEP NETWORK EMBEDDING (SDNE), CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK AND DEEP NEURAL NETWORK, WHICH PREDICTS THE POTENTIAL CIRCRNA-MIRNA ASSOCIATIONS, CALLED WORD2VEC, SDNE, CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK AND DEEP NEURAL NETWORK (WSCD). SPECIFICALLY, THE WSCD MODEL EXTRACTS ATTRIBUTE FEATURE AND BEHAVIOUR FEATURE BY WORD EMBEDDING AND GRAPH EMBEDDING ALGORITHM, RESPECTIVELY, AND ULTIMATELY FEED THEM INTO A FEATURE FUSION MODEL CONSTRUCTED BY COMBINING CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK AND DEEP NEURAL NETWORK TO DEDUCE POTENTIAL CIRCRNA-MIRNA INTERACTIONS. THE PROPOSED METHOD IS PROVED ON DATASET AND OBTAINED A PREDICTION ACCURACY AND AN AREA UNDER THE RECEIVER OPERATING CHARACTERISTIC CURVE OF 81.61% AND 0.8898, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH IS SHOWN TO HAVE MUCH HIGHER ACCURACY THAN THE STATE-OF-THE-ART MODELS AND CLASSIFIER MODELS IN PREDICTION. IN ADDITION, 23 MIRNA-RELATED CIRCULAR RNAS (CIRCRNAS) FROM THE TOP 30 WERE CONFIRMED IN RELEVANT EXPERIENCES. IN THESE WORKS, ALL RESULTS REPRESENT THAT WSCD WOULD BE A HELPFUL SUPPLEMENTARY RELIABLE METHOD FOR PREDICTING POTENTIAL MIRNA-CIRCRNA ASSOCIATIONS COMPARED TO WET LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
A NOVEL DEEP LEARNING APPROACH TO EXTRACT CHINESE CLINICAL ENTITIES FOR LUNG CANCER SCREENING AND STAGING. BACKGROUND: COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY (CT) REPORTS RECORD A LARGE VOLUME OF VALUABLE INFORMATION ABOUT PATIENTS' CONDITIONS AND THE INTERPRETATIONS OF RADIOLOGY IMAGES FROM RADIOLOGISTS, WHICH CAN BE USED FOR CLINICAL DECISION-MAKING AND FURTHER ACADEMIC STUDY. HOWEVER, THE FREE-TEXT NATURE OF CLINICAL REPORTS IS A CRITICAL BARRIER TO USE THIS DATA MORE EFFECTIVELY. IN THIS STUDY, WE INVESTIGATE A NOVEL DEEP LEARNING METHOD TO EXTRACT ENTITIES FROM CHINESE CT REPORTS FOR LUNG CANCER SCREENING AND TNM STAGING. METHODS: THE PROPOSED APPROACH PRESENTS A NEW NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION ALGORITHM, NAMELY THE BERT-BASED-BILSTM-TRANSFORMER NETWORK (BERT-BTN) WITH PRE-TRAINING, TO EXTRACT CLINICAL ENTITIES FOR LUNG CANCER SCREENING AND STAGING. SPECIFICALLY, INSTEAD OF TRADITIONAL WORD EMBEDDING METHODS, BERT IS APPLIED TO LEARN THE DEEP SEMANTIC REPRESENTATIONS OF CHARACTERS. FOLLOWING THE LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY LAYER, A TRANSFORMER LAYER IS ADDED TO CAPTURE THE GLOBAL DEPENDENCIES BETWEEN CHARACTERS. BESIDES, PRE-TRAINING TECHNIQUE IS EMPLOYED TO ALLEVIATE THE PROBLEM OF INSUFFICIENT LABELED DATA. RESULTS: WE VERIFY THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROPOSED APPROACH ON A CLINICAL DATASET CONTAINING 359 CT REPORTS COLLECTED FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF THORACIC SURGERY II OF PEKING UNIVERSITY CANCER HOSPITAL. THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS SHOW THAT THE PROPOSED APPROACH ACHIEVES AN 85.96% MACRO-F1 SCORE UNDER EXACT MATCH SCHEME, WHICH IMPROVES THE PERFORMANCE BY 1.38%, 1.84%, 3.81%,4.29%,5.12%,5.29% AND 8.84% COMPARED TO BERT-BTN, BERT-LSTM, BERT-FINE-TUNE, BERT-TRANSFORMER, FASTTEXT-BTN, FASTTEXT-BILSTM AND FASTTEXT-TRANSFORMER, RESPECTIVELY. CONCLUSIONS: IN THIS STUDY, WE DEVELOPED A NOVEL DEEP LEARNING METHOD, I.E., BERT-BTN WITH PRE-TRAINING, TO EXTRACT THE CLINICAL ENTITIES FROM CHINESE CT REPORTS. THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE PROPOSED APPROACH CAN EFFICIENTLY RECOGNIZE VARIOUS CLINICAL ENTITIES ABOUT LUNG CANCER SCREENING AND STAGING, WHICH SHOWS THE POTENTIAL FOR FURTHER CLINICAL DECISION-MAKING AND ACADEMIC RESEARCH.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
A NOVEL PATIENT SIMILARITY NETWORK (PSN) FRAMEWORK BASED ON MULTI-MODEL DEEP LEARNING FOR PRECISION MEDICINE. PRECISION MEDICINE CAN BE DEFINED AS THE COMPARISON OF A NEW PATIENT WITH EXISTING PATIENTS THAT HAVE SIMILAR CHARACTERISTICS AND CAN BE REFERRED TO AS PATIENT SIMILARITY. SEVERAL DEEP LEARNING MODELS HAVE BEEN USED TO BUILD AND APPLY PATIENT SIMILARITY NETWORKS (PSNS). HOWEVER, THE CHALLENGES RELATED TO DATA HETEROGENEITY AND DIMENSIONALITY MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO USE A SINGLE MODEL TO REDUCE DATA DIMENSIONALITY AND CAPTURE THE FEATURES OF DIVERSE DATA TYPES. IN THIS PAPER, WE PROPOSE A MULTI-MODEL PSN THAT CONSIDERS HETEROGENEOUS STATIC AND DYNAMIC DATA. THE COMBINATION OF DEEP LEARNING MODELS AND PSN ALLOWS AMPLE CLINICAL EVIDENCE AND INFORMATION EXTRACTION AGAINST WHICH SIMILAR PATIENTS CAN BE COMPARED. WE USE THE BIDIRECTIONAL ENCODER REPRESENTATIONS FROM TRANSFORMERS (BERT) TO ANALYZE THE CONTEXTUAL DATA AND GENERATE WORD EMBEDDING, WHERE SEMANTIC FEATURES ARE CAPTURED USING A CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (CNN). DYNAMIC DATA ARE ANALYZED USING A LONG-SHORT-TERM-MEMORY (LSTM)-BASED AUTOENCODER, WHICH REDUCES DATA DIMENSIONALITY AND PRESERVES THE TEMPORAL FEATURES OF THE DATA. WE PROPOSE A DATA FUSION APPROACH COMBINING TEMPORAL AND CLINICAL NARRATIVE DATA TO ESTIMATE PATIENT SIMILARITY. THE EXPERIMENTS WE CONDUCTED PROVED THAT OUR MODEL PROVIDES A HIGHER CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY IN DETERMINING VARIOUS PATIENT HEALTH OUTCOMES WHEN COMPARED WITH OTHER TRADITIONAL CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHMS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
A NOVEL POSITION-SPECIFIC ENCODING ALGORITHM (SEQPOSE) OF NUCLEOTIDE SEQUENCES AND ITS APPLICATION FOR DETECTING ENHANCERS. ENHANCERS ARE SHORT GENOMIC REGIONS EXERTING TISSUE-SPECIFIC REGULATORY ROLES, USUALLY FOR REMOTE CODING REGIONS. ENHANCERS ARE OBSERVED IN BOTH PROKARYOTIC AND EUKARYOTIC GENOMES, AND THEIR DETECTIONS FACILITATE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE TRANSCRIPTIONAL REGULATION MECHANISM. THE ACCURATE DETECTION AND TRANSCRIPTIONAL REGULATION STRENGTH EVALUATION OF THE ENHANCERS REMAIN A MAJOR BIOINFORMATICS CHALLENGE. MOST OF THE CURRENT STUDIES UTILIZED THE STATISTICAL FEATURES OF SHORT FIXED-LENGTH NUCLEOTIDE SEQUENCES. THIS STUDY INTRODUCES THE LOCATION INFORMATION OF EACH K-MER (SEQPOSE) INTO THE ENCODING STRATEGY OF A DNA SEQUENCE AND EMPLOYS THE ATTENTION MECHANISM IN THE TWO-LAYER BI-DIRECTIONAL LONG-SHORT TERM MEMORY (BD-LSTM) MODEL (SPENHANCER) FOR THE ENHANCER DETECTION PROBLEM. THE FIRST LAYER OF THE DELIVERED CLASSIFIER DISCRIMINATES BETWEEN ENHANCERS AND NON-ENHANCERS, AND THE SECOND LAYER EVALUATES THE TRANSCRIPTIONAL REGULATION STRENGTH OF THE DETECTED ENHANCER. THE SEQPOSE-ENCODED FEATURES ARE SELECTED BY THE CHI-SQUARED TEST, AND 45 POSITIONS ARE REMOVED FROM FURTHER ANALYSIS. THE EXISTING STUDIES MAY FOCUS ON SELECTING THE STATISTICAL DNA SEQUENCE DESCRIPTORS WITH LARGE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE PREDICTION MODELS. THIS STUDY DOES NOT UTILIZE THESE STATISTICAL DNA SEQUENCE DESCRIPTORS. THEN THE WORD VECTOR OF THE SEQPOSE-ENCODED FEATURES IS OBTAINED BY USING THE WORD EMBEDDING LAYER. THIS STUDY HYPOTHESIZES THAT DIFFERENT WORD VECTOR FEATURES MAY CONTRIBUTE DIFFERENTLY TO THE ENHANCER DETECTION MODEL, AND ASSIGNS DIFFERENT WEIGHTS TO THESE WORD VECTORS THROUGH THE ATTENTION MECHANISM IN THE BD-LSTM MODEL. THE PREVIOUS STUDY GENEROUSLY PROVIDED THE TRAINING AND INDEPENDENT TEST DATASETS, AND THE PROPOSED SPENHANCER IS COMPARED WITH THE THREE EXISTING STATE-OF-THE-ART STUDIES USING THE SAME EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE. THE LEAVE-ONE-OUT VALIDATION DATA ON THE TRAINING DATASET SHOWS THAT THE PROPOSED SPENHANCER ACHIEVES SIMILAR DETECTION PERFORMANCES AS THE THREE EXISTING STUDIES. WHILE SPENHANCER ACHIEVES THE BEST OVERALL PERFORMANCE METRIC MCC FOR BOTH OF THE TWO BINARY CLASSIFICATION PROBLEMS ON THE INDEPENDENT TEST DATASET. THE EXPERIMENTAL DATA SHOWS THAT THE STRATEGY OF REMOVING REDUNDANT POSITIONS (SEQPOSE) MAY HELP IMPROVE THE DNA SEQUENCE-BASED PREDICTION MODELS. SPENHANCER MAY SERVE WELL AS A COMPLEMENTARY MODEL TO THE EXISTING STUDIES, ESPECIALLY FOR THE NOVEL QUERY ENHANCERS THAT ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE TRAINING DATASET.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
A PRINCIPLED APPROACH TO FEATURE SELECTION IN MODELS OF SENTENCE PROCESSING. AMONG THEORIES OF HUMAN LANGUAGE COMPREHENSION, CUE-BASED MEMORY RETRIEVAL HAS PROVEN TO BE A USEFUL FRAMEWORK FOR UNDERSTANDING WHEN AND HOW PROCESSING DIFFICULTY ARISES IN THE RESOLUTION OF LONG-DISTANCE DEPENDENCIES. MOST PREVIOUS WORK IN THIS AREA HAS ASSUMED THAT VERY GENERAL RETRIEVAL CUES LIKE [+SUBJECT] OR [+SINGULAR] DO THE WORK OF IDENTIFYING (AND SOMETIMES MISIDENTIFYING) A RETRIEVAL TARGET IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH A DEPENDENCY BETWEEN WORDS. HOWEVER, RECENT WORK SUGGESTS THAT GENERAL, HANDPICKED RETRIEVAL CUES LIKE THESE MAY NOT BE ENOUGH TO EXPLAIN ILLUSIONS OF PLAUSIBILITY (CUNNINGS & STURT, 2018), WHICH CAN ARISE IN SENTENCES LIKE THE LETTER NEXT TO THE PORCELAIN PLATE SHATTERED. CAPTURING SUCH RETRIEVAL INTERFERENCE EFFECTS REQUIRES LEXICALLY SPECIFIC FEATURES AND RETRIEVAL CUES, BUT HANDPICKING THE FEATURES IS HARD TO DO IN A PRINCIPLED WAY AND GREATLY INCREASES MODELER DEGREES OF FREEDOM. TO REMEDY THIS, WE USE WELL-ESTABLISHED WORD EMBEDDING METHODS FOR CREATING DISTRIBUTED LEXICAL FEATURE REPRESENTATIONS THAT ENCODE INFORMATION RELEVANT FOR RETRIEVAL USING DISTRIBUTED RETRIEVAL CUE VECTORS. WE SHOW THAT THE SIMILARITY BETWEEN THE FEATURE AND CUE VECTORS (A MEASURE OF PLAUSIBILITY) PREDICTS TOTAL READING TIMES IN CUNNINGS AND STURT'S EYE-TRACKING DATA. THE FEATURES CAN EASILY BE PLUGGED INTO EXISTING PARSING MODELS (INCLUDING CUE-BASED RETRIEVAL AND SELF-ORGANIZED PARSING), PUTTING VERY DIFFERENT MODELS ON MORE EQUAL FOOTING AND FACILITATING FUTURE QUANTITATIVE COMPARISONS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
A REVIEW ON SENTIMENT ANALYSIS AND EMOTION DETECTION FROM TEXT. SOCIAL NETWORKING PLATFORMS HAVE BECOME AN ESSENTIAL MEANS FOR COMMUNICATING FEELINGS TO THE ENTIRE WORLD DUE TO RAPID EXPANSION IN THE INTERNET ERA. SEVERAL PEOPLE USE TEXTUAL CONTENT, PICTURES, AUDIO, AND VIDEO TO EXPRESS THEIR FEELINGS OR VIEWPOINTS. TEXT COMMUNICATION VIA WEB-BASED NETWORKING MEDIA, ON THE OTHER HAND, IS SOMEWHAT OVERWHELMING. EVERY SECOND, A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF UNSTRUCTURED DATA IS GENERATED ON THE INTERNET DUE TO SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS. THE DATA MUST BE PROCESSED AS RAPIDLY AS GENERATED TO COMPREHEND HUMAN PSYCHOLOGY, AND IT CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED USING SENTIMENT ANALYSIS, WHICH RECOGNIZES POLARITY IN TEXTS. IT ASSESSES WHETHER THE AUTHOR HAS A NEGATIVE, POSITIVE, OR NEUTRAL ATTITUDE TOWARD AN ITEM, ADMINISTRATION, INDIVIDUAL, OR LOCATION. IN SOME APPLICATIONS, SENTIMENT ANALYSIS IS INSUFFICIENT AND HENCE REQUIRES EMOTION DETECTION, WHICH DETERMINES AN INDIVIDUAL'S EMOTIONAL/MENTAL STATE PRECISELY. THIS REVIEW PAPER PROVIDES UNDERSTANDING INTO LEVELS OF SENTIMENT ANALYSIS, VARIOUS EMOTION MODELS, AND THE PROCESS OF SENTIMENT ANALYSIS AND EMOTION DETECTION FROM TEXT. FINALLY, THIS PAPER DISCUSSES THE CHALLENGES FACED DURING SENTIMENT AND EMOTION ANALYSIS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
A SEMANTIC ANALYSIS AND COMMUNITY DETECTION-BASED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE MODEL FOR CORE HERB DISCOVERY FROM THE LITERATURE: TAKING CHRONIC GLOMERULONEPHRITIS TREATMENT AS A CASE STUDY. THE TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE (TCM) FORMULA IS THE MAIN TREATMENT METHOD OF TCM. A FORMULA OFTEN CONTAINS MULTIPLE HERBS WHERE CORE HERBS PLAY A CRITICAL THERAPEUTIC EFFECT FOR TREATING DISEASES. IT IS OF GREAT SIGNIFICANCE TO FIND OUT THE CORE HERBS IN FORMULAE FOR PROVIDING EVIDENCES AND REFERENCES FOR THE CLINICAL APPLICATION OF CHINESE HERBS AND FORMULAE. IN THIS PAPER, WE PROPOSE A CORE HERB DISCOVERY MODEL CHDSC BASED ON SEMANTIC ANALYSIS AND COMMUNITY DETECTION TO DISCOVER THE CORE HERBS FOR TREATING A CERTAIN DISEASE FROM LARGE-SCALE LITERATURE, WHICH INCLUDES THREE STAGES: CORPUS CONSTRUCTION, HERB NETWORK ESTABLISHMENT, AND CORE HERB DISCOVERY. IN CHDSC, TWO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE MODULES ARE USED, WHERE THE CHINESE WORD EMBEDDING ALGORITHM ESSP2VEC IS DESIGNED TO ANALYSE THE SEMANTICS OF HERBS IN CHINESE LITERATURE BASED ON THE STROKE, STRUCTURE, AND PINYIN FEATURES OF CHINESE CHARACTERS, AND THE LABEL PROPAGATION-BASED ALGORITHM LILPA IS ADOPTED TO DETECT HERB COMMUNITIES AND CORE HERBS IN THE HERBAL SEMANTIC NETWORK CONSTRUCTED FROM LARGE-SCALE LITERATURE. TO VALIDATE THE PROPOSED MODEL, WE CHOOSE CHRONIC GLOMERULONEPHRITIS (CGN) AS AN EXAMPLE, SEARCH 1126 ARTICLES ABOUT HOW TO TREAT CGN IN TCM FROM THE CHINA NATIONAL KNOWLEDGE INFRASTRUCTURE (CNKI), AND APPLY CHDSC TO ANALYSE THE COLLECTED LITERATURE. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS REVEAL THAT CHDSC DISCOVERS THREE MAJOR HERB COMMUNITIES AND EIGHTEEN CORE HERBS FOR TREATING DIFFERENT CGN SYNDROMES WITH HIGH ACCURACY. THE COMMUNITY SIZE, DEGREE, AND CLOSENESS CENTRALITY DISTRIBUTIONS OF THE HERB NETWORK ARE ANALYSED TO MINE THE LAWS OF CORE HERBS. AS A RESULT, WE CAN OBSERVE THAT CORE HERBS MAINLY EXIST IN THE COMMUNITIES WITH MORE THAN 25 HERBS. THE DEGREE AND CLOSENESS CENTRALITY OF CORE HERB NODES CONCENTRATE ON THE RANGE OF [15, 40] AND [0.25, 0.45], RESPECTIVELY. THUS, SEMANTIC ANALYSIS AND COMMUNITY DETECTION ARE HELPFUL FOR MINING EFFECTIVE CORE HERBS FOR TREATING A CERTAIN DISEASE FROM LARGE-SCALE LITERATURE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
A SHORTEST DEPENDENCY PATH BASED CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK FOR PROTEIN-PROTEIN RELATION EXTRACTION. THE STATE-OF-THE-ART METHODS FOR PROTEIN-PROTEIN INTERACTION (PPI) EXTRACTION ARE PRIMARILY BASED ON KERNEL METHODS, AND THEIR PERFORMANCES STRONGLY DEPEND ON THE HANDCRAFT FEATURES. IN THIS PAPER, WE TACKLE PPI EXTRACTION BY USING CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS (CNN) AND PROPOSE A SHORTEST DEPENDENCY PATH BASED CNN (SDPCNN) MODEL. THE PROPOSED METHOD (1) ONLY TAKES THE SDP AND WORD EMBEDDING AS INPUT AND (2) COULD AVOID BIAS FROM FEATURE SELECTION BY USING CNN. WE PERFORMED EXPERIMENTS ON STANDARD AIMED AND BIOINFER DATASETS, AND THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS DEMONSTRATED THAT OUR APPROACH OUTPERFORMED STATE-OF-THE-ART KERNEL BASED METHODS. IN PARTICULAR, BY TRACKING THE SDPCNN MODEL, WE FIND THAT SDPCNN COULD EXTRACT KEY FEATURES AUTOMATICALLY AND IT IS VERIFIED THAT PRETRAINED WORD EMBEDDING IS CRUCIAL IN PPI TASK.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
A STUDY OF DNN-BASED MEDIA LITERACY AND DISTANCE EDUCATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM IN THE CONTEXT OF PARTICIPATORY CULTURE. THROUGH AN IN-DEPTH STUDY AND ANALYSIS OF THE INTEGRATION OF MEDIA LITERACY WITH DISTANCE EDUCATION MANAGEMENT USING THE DNN ALGORITHM IN THE CONTEXT OF PARTICIPATORY CULTURE, AND THE DESIGN OF A DISTANCE EDUCATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR APPLICATION IN ACTUAL TEACHING, THE WORD EMBEDDING MODEL IS USED TO EMBED THE RATINGS AND TAGS, RESPECTIVELY; THEN, THE SELF-ENCODER IS USED TO EXTRACT TEXTUAL FEATURES FOR ITEM TAGS, WHILE DNN IS USED TO EXTRACT FEATURES FOR USER TAGGING BEHAVIORS; FINALLY, THE FULLY CONNECTED NEURAL NETWORK IS USED TO PREDICT RATINGS FOR THE FUSED USER AND ITEM FEATURES. THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS SHOW THAT THE OPTIMIZED RECOMMENDATION MODEL EFFECTIVELY REDUCES THE USER RATING PREDICTION ERROR WHILE ALLEVIATING THE COLD START PROBLEM. A BLOCKCHAIN-BASED LEARNING PLATFORM IS DESIGNED. THE PURPOSE IS TO SOLVE THE CONTRADICTION BETWEEN CENTRALIZED STORAGE AND SOCIAL TRUST, AND TO TRANSFER THE MANAGEMENT OF EDUCATIONAL CERTIFICATION RESOURCES FROM CENTRALIZED CONTROL MANAGEMENT TO DISTRIBUTED CONTROL MANAGEMENT. THIS PLATFORM CAN RECORD IN STAGES A VARIETY OF VERIFICATION INFORMATION AND COURSE CERTIFICATE INFORMATION COLLECTED BY STUDENTS IN THE PROCESS OF LEARNING COURSES, CREATE COURSE CERTIFICATES CONTAINING DIGITAL SUMMARIES OF LEARNING INFORMATION, AND STORE THEM ON THE CHAIN TO ENSURE THE INTEGRITY AND TRACEABILITY OF DATA IN THE LEARNING PROCESS. THIS PAPER IMPLEMENTS A BLOCKCHAIN-BASED ONLINE EDUCATION SYSTEM, WHICH ENSURES THAT SYSTEM DATA WILL NOT BE MALICIOUSLY QUERIED AND DYNAMICALLY CHANGED BY MANAGEMENT.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
A STUDYFORREST EXTENSION, AN ANNOTATION OF SPOKEN LANGUAGE IN THE GERMAN DUBBED MOVIE "FORREST GUMP" AND ITS AUDIO-DESCRIPTION. HERE WE PRESENT AN ANNOTATION OF SPEECH IN THE AUDIO-VISUAL MOVIE "FORREST GUMP" AND ITS AUDIO-DESCRIPTION FOR A VISUALLY IMPAIRED AUDIENCE, AS AN ADDITION TO A LARGE PUBLIC FUNCTIONAL BRAIN IMAGING DATASET ( STUDYFORREST.ORG). THE ANNOTATION PROVIDES INFORMATION ABOUT THE EXACT TIMING OF EACH OF THE MORE THAN 2500 SPOKEN SENTENCES, 16,000 WORDS (INCLUDING 202 NON-SPEECH VOCALIZATIONS), 66,000 PHONEMES, AND THEIR CORRESPONDING SPEAKER. ADDITIONALLY, FOR EVERY WORD, WE PROVIDE LEMMATIZATION, A SIMPLE PART-OF-SPEECH-TAGGING (15 GRAMMATICAL CATEGORIES), A DETAILED PART-OF-SPEECH TAGGING (43 GRAMMATICAL CATEGORIES), SYNTACTIC DEPENDENCIES, AND A SEMANTIC ANALYSIS BASED ON WORD EMBEDDING WHICH REPRESENTS EACH WORD IN A 300-DIMENSIONAL SEMANTIC SPACE. TO VALIDATE THE DATASET'S QUALITY, WE BUILD A MODEL OF HEMODYNAMIC BRAIN ACTIVITY BASED ON INFORMATION DRAWN FROM THE ANNOTATION. RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE ANNOTATION'S CONTENT AND QUALITY ENABLE INDEPENDENT RESEARCHERS TO CREATE MODELS OF BRAIN ACTIVITY CORRELATING WITH A VARIETY OF LINGUISTIC ASPECTS UNDER CONDITIONS OF NEAR-REAL-LIFE COMPLEXITY.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
A TOPIC RECOGNITION METHOD OF NEWS TEXT BASED ON WORD EMBEDDING ENHANCEMENT. TOPIC RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN COMMONLY APPLIED TO IDENTIFY DIFFERENT CATEGORIES OF NEWS TOPICS FROM THE VAST AMOUNT OF WEB INFORMATION, WHICH HAS A WIDE APPLICATION PROSPECT IN THE FIELD OF ONLINE PUBLIC OPINION MONITORING, NEWS RECOMMENDATION, AND SO ON. HOWEVER, IT IS VERY CHALLENGING TO EFFECTIVELY UTILIZE KEY FEATURE INFORMATION SUCH AS SYNTAX AND SEMANTICS IN THE TEXT TO IMPROVE TOPIC RECOGNITION ACCURACY. SOME RESEARCHERS PROPOSED TO COMBINE THE TOPIC MODEL WITH THE WORD EMBEDDING MODEL, WHOSE RESULTS HAD SHOWN THAT THIS APPROACH COULD ENRICH TEXT REPRESENTATION AND BENEFIT NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING DOWNSTREAM TASKS. HOWEVER, FOR THE TOPIC RECOGNITION PROBLEM OF NEWS TEXTS, THERE IS CURRENTLY NO STANDARD WAY OF COMBINING TOPIC MODEL AND WORD EMBEDDING MODEL. BESIDES, SOME EXISTING SIMILAR APPROACHES WERE MORE COMPLEX AND DID NOT CONSIDER THE FUSION BETWEEN TOPIC DISTRIBUTION OF DIFFERENT GRANULARITY AND WORD EMBEDDING INFORMATION. THEREFORE, THIS PAPER PROPOSES A NOVEL TEXT REPRESENTATION METHOD BASED ON WORD EMBEDDING ENHANCEMENT AND FURTHER FORMS A FULL-PROCESS TOPIC RECOGNITION FRAMEWORK FOR NEWS TEXT. IN CONTRAST TO TRADITIONAL TOPIC RECOGNITION METHODS, THIS FRAMEWORK IS DESIGNED TO USE THE PROBABILISTIC TOPIC MODEL LDA, THE WORD EMBEDDING MODELS WORD2VEC AND GLOVE TO FULLY EXTRACT AND INTEGRATE THE TOPIC DISTRIBUTION, SEMANTIC KNOWLEDGE, AND SYNTACTIC RELATIONSHIP OF THE TEXT, AND THEN USE POPULAR CLASSIFIERS TO AUTOMATICALLY RECOGNIZE THE TOPIC CATEGORIES OF NEWS BASED ON THE OBTAINED TEXT REPRESENTATION VECTORS. AS A RESULT, THE PROPOSED FRAMEWORK CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DOCUMENT AND TOPIC AND THE CONTEXT INFORMATION, WHICH IMPROVES THE EXPRESSIVE ABILITY AND REDUCES THE DIMENSIONALITY. BASED ON THE TWO BENCHMARK DATASETS OF 20NEWSGROUP AND BBC NEWS, THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS VERIFY THE EFFECTIVENESS AND SUPERIORITY OF THE PROPOSED METHOD BASED ON WORD EMBEDDING ENHANCEMENT FOR THE NEWS TOPIC RECOGNITION PROBLEM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
A TRANSFORMER ARCHITECTURE BASED ON BERT AND 2D CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK TO IDENTIFY DNA ENHANCERS FROM SEQUENCE INFORMATION. RECENTLY, LANGUAGE REPRESENTATION MODELS HAVE DRAWN A LOT OF ATTENTION IN THE NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING FIELD DUE TO THEIR REMARKABLE RESULTS. AMONG THEM, BIDIRECTIONAL ENCODER REPRESENTATIONS FROM TRANSFORMERS (BERT) HAS PROVEN TO BE A SIMPLE, YET POWERFUL LANGUAGE MODEL THAT ACHIEVED NOVEL STATE-OF-THE-ART PERFORMANCE. BERT ADOPTED THE CONCEPT OF CONTEXTUALIZED WORD EMBEDDING TO CAPTURE THE SEMANTICS AND CONTEXT OF THE WORDS IN WHICH THEY APPEARED. IN THIS STUDY, WE PRESENT A NOVEL TECHNIQUE BY INCORPORATING BERT-BASED MULTILINGUAL MODEL IN BIOINFORMATICS TO REPRESENT THE INFORMATION OF DNA SEQUENCES. WE TREATED DNA SEQUENCES AS NATURAL SENTENCES AND THEN USED BERT MODELS TO TRANSFORM THEM INTO FIXED-LENGTH NUMERICAL MATRICES. AS A CASE STUDY, WE APPLIED OUR METHOD TO DNA ENHANCER PREDICTION, WHICH IS A WELL-KNOWN AND CHALLENGING PROBLEM IN THIS FIELD. WE THEN OBSERVED THAT OUR BERT-BASED FEATURES IMPROVED MORE THAN 5-10% IN TERMS OF SENSITIVITY, SPECIFICITY, ACCURACY AND MATTHEWS CORRELATION COEFFICIENT COMPARED TO THE CURRENT STATE-OF-THE-ART FEATURES IN BIOINFORMATICS. MOREOVER, ADVANCED EXPERIMENTS SHOW THAT DEEP LEARNING (AS REPRESENTED BY 2D CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS; CNN) HOLDS POTENTIAL IN LEARNING BERT FEATURES BETTER THAN OTHER TRADITIONAL MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES. IN CONCLUSION, WE SUGGEST THAT BERT AND 2D CNNS COULD OPEN A NEW AVENUE IN BIOLOGICAL MODELING USING SEQUENCE INFORMATION.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
A VECTOR-BASED SEMANTIC RELATEDNESS MEASURE USING MULTIPLE RELATIONS WITHIN SNOMED CT AND UMLS. OBJECTIVE: TO PROPOSE A NEW VECTOR-BASED RELATEDNESS METRIC THAT DERIVES WORD VECTORS FROM THE INTRINSIC STRUCTURE OF BIOMEDICAL ONTOLOGIES, WITHOUT CONSULTING EXTERNAL RESOURCES SUCH AS LARGE-SCALE BIOMEDICAL CORPORA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: SNOMED CT ON THE MAPPING LAYER OF UMLS WAS USED AS A TESTBED ONTOLOGY. VECTORS WERE CREATED FOR EVERY CONCEPT AT THE END OF ALL SEMANTIC RELATIONS-ATTRIBUTE-VALUE RELATIONS AND DESCENDANTS AS WELL AS IS_A RELATION-OF THE DEFINING CONCEPT. THE COSINE SIMILARITY BETWEEN THE AVERAGES OF THOSE VECTORS WITH RESPECT TO EACH DEFINING CONCEPT WAS COMPUTED TO PRODUCE A FINAL SEMANTIC RELATEDNESS. RESULTS: TWO BENCHMARK SETS THAT INCLUDE A TOTAL OF 62 BIOMEDICAL TERM PAIRS WERE USED FOR EVALUATION. SPEARMAN'S RANK COEFFICIENT OF THE CURRENT METHOD WAS 0.655, 0.744, AND 0.742 WITH THE RELATEDNESS RATED BY PHYSICIANS, CODERS, AND MEDICAL EXPERTS, RESPECTIVELY. THE PROPOSED METHOD WAS COMPARABLE TO A WORD-EMBEDDING METHOD AND OUTPERFORMED PATH-BASED, INFORMATION CONTENT-BASED, AND ANOTHER MULTIPLE RELATION-BASED RELATEDNESS METRICS. DISCUSSION: THE CURRENT STUDY DEMONSTRATED THAT THE ADDITION OF ATTRIBUTE RELATIONS TO THE IS_A HIERARCHY OF SNOMED CT BETTER CONFORMS TO THE HUMAN SENSE OF RELATEDNESS THAN MODELS BASED ON TAXONOMIC RELATIONS. THE CURRENT APPROACH ALSO SHOWED THAT IT IS ROBUST TO THE DESIGN INCONSISTENCY OF ONTOLOGIES. CONCLUSION: UNLIKE THE PREVIOUS VECTOR-BASED APPROACH, THE CURRENT STUDY EXPLOITED THE INTRINSIC SEMANTIC STRUCTURE OF AN ONTOLOGY, PRECLUDING THE NEED FOR EXTERNAL TEXTUAL RESOURCES TO OBTAIN CONTEXT INFORMATION OF DEFINING TERMS. FUTURE RESEARCH IS RECOMMENDED TO PROVE THE VALIDITY OF THE CURRENT METHOD WITH OTHER BIOMEDICAL ONTOLOGIES.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
A WORD EMBEDDING TECHNIQUE FOR SENTIMENT ANALYSIS OF SOCIAL MEDIA TO UNDERSTAND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ISLAMOPHOBIC INCIDENTS AND MEDIA PORTRAYAL OF MUSLIM COMMUNITIES. ISLAMOPHOBIA IS A SENTIMENT AGAINST THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY; RECENTLY, ATROCITIES TOWARDS MUSLIM COMMUNITIES WITNESSED THIS SENTIMENT GLOBALLY. THIS RESEARCH INVESTIGATES THE CORRELATION BETWEEN HOW NEWS STORIES COVERED BY MAINSTREAM NEWS CHANNELS IMPEDE THE HATE SPEECH/ISLAMOPHOBIC SENTIMENT. TO EXAMINE THE OBJECTIVE MENTIONED ABOVE, WE SHORTLISTED THIRTEEN MAINSTREAM NEWS CHANNELS AND THE TEN MOST WIDELY REPORTED ISLAMOPHOBIC INCIDENTS ACROSS THE GLOBE FOR EXPERIMENTATION. TRANSCRIPTS OF THE NEWS STORIES ARE SCRAPED ALONG WITH THEIR COMMENTS, LIKES, DISLIKES, AND RECOMMENDED VIDEOS AS THE USERS' RESPONSES. WE USED A WORD EMBEDDING TECHNIQUE FOR SENTIMENT ANALYSIS, E.G., ISLAMOPHOBIC OR NOT, THREE TEXTUAL VARIABLES, VIDEO TITLES, VIDEO TRANSCRIPTS, AND COMMENTS. THIS SENTIMENT ANALYSIS HELPED TO COMPUTE METRIC VARIABLES. THE I-SCORE REPRESENTS THE EXTENT OF PORTRAYALS OF MUSLIMS IN A PARTICULAR NEWS STORY. THE NEXT STEP IS TO CALCULATE THE CANONICAL CORRELATION BETWEEN VIDEO TRANSCRIPTS AND THEIR RESPECTIVE RESPONSES, EXPLAINING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN NEWS PORTRAYAL AND HATE SPEECH. THIS STUDY PROVIDES EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE OF HOW NEWS STORIES CAN PROMOTE ISLAMOPHOBIC SENTIMENTS AND EVENTUALLY ATROCITIES TOWARDS MUSLIM COMMUNITIES. IT ALSO PROVIDES THE IMPLICIT IMPACT OF REPORTING NEWS STORIES THAT MAY IMPACT HATE SPEECH AND CRIME AGAINST SPECIFIC COMMUNITIES.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
A WORD PAIR DATASET FOR SEMANTIC SIMILARITY AND RELATEDNESS IN KOREAN MEDICAL VOCABULARY: REFERENCE DEVELOPMENT AND VALIDATION. BACKGROUND: THE FACT THAT MEDICAL TERMS REQUIRE SPECIAL EXPERTISE AND ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY COMPLEX MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO EMPLOY NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING TECHNIQUES IN MEDICAL INFORMATICS. SEVERAL HUMAN-VALIDATED REFERENCE STANDARDS FOR MEDICAL TERMS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED TO EVALUATE WORD EMBEDDING MODELS USING THE SEMANTIC SIMILARITY AND RELATEDNESS OF MEDICAL WORD PAIRS. HOWEVER, THERE ARE VERY FEW REFERENCE STANDARDS IN NON-ENGLISH LANGUAGES. IN ADDITION, BECAUSE THE EXISTING REFERENCE STANDARDS WERE DEVELOPED A LONG TIME AGO, THERE IS A NEED TO DEVELOP AN UPDATED STANDARD TO REPRESENT RECENT FINDINGS IN MEDICAL SCIENCES. OBJECTIVE: WE PROPOSE A NEW KOREAN WORD PAIR REFERENCE SET TO VERIFY EMBEDDING MODELS. METHODS: FROM JANUARY 2010 TO DECEMBER 2020, 518 MEDICAL TEXTBOOKS, 72,844 HEALTH INFORMATION NEWS, AND 15,698 MEDICAL RESEARCH ARTICLES WERE COLLECTED, AND THE TOP 10,000 MEDICAL TERMS WERE SELECTED TO DEVELOP MEDICAL WORD PAIRS. ATTENDING PHYSICIANS (N=16) PARTICIPATED IN THE VERIFICATION OF THE DEVELOPED SET WITH 607 WORD PAIRS. RESULTS: THE PROPORTION OF WORD PAIRS ANSWERED BY ALL PARTICIPANTS WAS 90.8% (551/607) FOR THE SIMILARITY TASK AND 86.5% (525/605) FOR THE RELATEDNESS TASK. THE SIMILARITY AND RELATEDNESS OF THE WORD PAIR SHOWED A HIGH CORRELATION (RHO=0.70, P<.001). THE INTRACLASS CORRELATION COEFFICIENTS TO ASSESS THE INTERRATER AGREEMENTS OF THE WORD PAIR SETS WERE 0.47 ON THE SIMILARITY TASK AND 0.53 ON THE RELATEDNESS TASK. THE FINAL REFERENCE STANDARD WAS 604 WORD PAIRS FOR THE SIMILARITY TASK AND 599 WORD PAIRS FOR RELATEDNESS, EXCLUDING WORD PAIRS WITH ANSWERS CORRESPONDING TO OUTLIERS AND WORD PAIRS THAT WERE ANSWERED BY LESS THAN 50% OF ALL THE RESPONDENTS. WHEN FASTTEXT MODELS WERE APPLIED TO THE FINAL REFERENCE STANDARD WORD PAIR SETS, THE EMBEDDING MODELS LEARNING MEDICAL DOCUMENTS HAD A HIGHER CORRELATION BETWEEN THE CALCULATED COSINE SIMILARITY SCORES COMPARED TO HUMAN-JUDGED SIMILARITY AND RELATEDNESS SCORES (NAMU, RHO=0.12 VS WITH MEDICAL TEXT FOR THE SIMILARITY TASK, RHO=0.47; NAMU, RHO=0.02 VS WITH MEDICAL TEXT FOR THE RELATEDNESS TASK, RHO=0.30). CONCLUSIONS: KOREAN MEDICAL WORD PAIR REFERENCE STANDARD SETS FOR SEMANTIC SIMILARITY AND RELATEDNESS WERE DEVELOPED BASED ON MEDICAL DOCUMENTS FROM THE PAST 10 YEARS. IT IS EXPECTED THAT OUR WORD PAIR REFERENCE SETS WILL BE ACTIVELY UTILIZED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF MEDICAL AND MULTILINGUAL NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY IN THE FUTURE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
ABSTRACTIVE ARABIC TEXT SUMMARIZATION BASED ON DEEP LEARNING. TEXT SUMMARIZATION (TS) IS CONSIDERED ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT TASKS IN NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP). IT IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT CHALLENGES THAT STAND AGAINST THE MODERN COMPUTER SYSTEM'S CAPABILITIES WITH ALL ITS NEW IMPROVEMENT. MANY PAPERS AND RESEARCH STUDIES ADDRESS THIS TASK IN LITERATURE BUT ARE BEING CARRIED OUT IN EXTRACTIVE SUMMARIZATION, AND FEW OF THEM ARE BEING CARRIED OUT IN ABSTRACTIVE SUMMARIZATION, ESPECIALLY IN THE ARABIC LANGUAGE DUE TO ITS COMPLEXITY. IN THIS PAPER, AN ABSTRACTIVE ARABIC TEXT SUMMARIZATION SYSTEM IS PROPOSED, BASED ON A SEQUENCE-TO-SEQUENCE MODEL. THIS MODEL WORKS THROUGH TWO COMPONENTS, ENCODER AND DECODER. OUR AIM IS TO DEVELOP THE SEQUENCE-TO-SEQUENCE MODEL USING SEVERAL DEEP ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS TO INVESTIGATE WHICH OF THEM ACHIEVES THE BEST PERFORMANCE. DIFFERENT LAYERS OF GATED RECURRENT UNITS (GRU), LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY (LSTM), AND BIDIRECTIONAL LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY (BILSTM) HAVE BEEN USED TO DEVELOP THE ENCODER AND THE DECODER. IN ADDITION, THE GLOBAL ATTENTION MECHANISM HAS BEEN USED BECAUSE IT PROVIDES BETTER RESULTS THAN THE LOCAL ATTENTION MECHANISM. FURTHERMORE, ARABERT PREPROCESS HAS BEEN APPLIED IN THE DATA PREPROCESSING STAGE THAT HELPS THE MODEL TO UNDERSTAND THE ARABIC WORDS AND ACHIEVES STATE-OF-THE-ART RESULTS. MOREOVER, A COMPARISON BETWEEN THE SKIP-GRAM AND THE CONTINUOUS BAG OF WORDS (CBOW) WORD2VEC WORD EMBEDDING MODELS HAS BEEN MADE. WE HAVE BUILT THESE MODELS USING THE KERAS LIBRARY AND RUN-ON GOOGLE COLAB JUPITER NOTEBOOK TO RUN SEAMLESSLY. FINALLY, THE PROPOSED SYSTEM IS EVALUATED THROUGH ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L, AND BLEU EVALUATION METRICS. THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS SHOW THAT THREE LAYERS OF BILSTM HIDDEN STATES AT THE ENCODER ACHIEVE THE BEST PERFORMANCE. IN ADDITION, OUR PROPOSED SYSTEM OUTPERFORMS THE OTHER LATEST RESEARCH STUDIES. ALSO, THE RESULTS SHOW THAT ABSTRACTIVE SUMMARIZATION MODELS THAT USE THE SKIP-GRAM WORD2VEC MODEL OUTPERFORM THE MODELS THAT USE THE CBOW WORD2VEC MODEL.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
ADAPTING WORD EMBEDDINGS FROM MULTIPLE DOMAINS TO SYMPTOM RECOGNITION FROM PSYCHIATRIC NOTES. MENTAL HEALTH IS INCREASINGLY RECOGNIZED AN IMPORTANT TOPIC IN HEALTHCARE. INFORMATION CONCERNING PSYCHIATRIC SYMPTOMS IS CRITICAL FOR THE TIMELY DIAGNOSIS OF MENTAL DISORDERS, AS WELL AS FOR THE PERSONALIZATION OF INTERVENTIONS. HOWEVER, THE DIVERSITY AND SPARSITY OF PSYCHIATRIC SYMPTOMS MAKE IT CHALLENGING FOR CONVENTIONAL NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING TECHNIQUES TO AUTOMATICALLY EXTRACT SUCH INFORMATION FROM CLINICAL TEXT. TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM, THIS STUDY TAKES THE INITIATIVE TO USE AND ADAPT WORD EMBEDDINGS FROM FOUR SOURCE DOMAINS - INTENSIVE CARE, BIOMEDICAL LITERATURE, WIKIPEDIA AND PSYCHIATRIC FORUM - TO RECOGNIZE SYMPTOMS IN THE TARGET DOMAIN OF PSYCHIATRY. WE INVESTIGATED FOUR DIFFERENT APPROACHES INCLUDING 1) ONLY USING WORD EMBEDDINGS OF THE SOURCE DOMAIN, 2) DIRECTLY COMBINING DATA OF THE SOURCE AND TARGET TO GENERATE WORD EMBEDDINGS, 3) ASSIGNING DIFFERENT WEIGHTS TO WORD EMBEDDINGS, AND 4) RETRAINING THE WORD EMBEDDING MODEL OF THE SOURCE DOMAIN USING A CORPUS OF THE TARGET DOMAIN. TO THE BEST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE, THIS IS THE FIRST WORK OF ADAPTING MULTIPLE WORD EMBEDDINGS OF EXTERNAL DOMAINS TO IMPROVE PSYCHIATRIC SYMPTOM RECOGNITION IN CLINICAL TEXT. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE LAST TWO APPROACHES OUTPERFORMED THE BASELINE METHODS, INDICATING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR NEW STRATEGIES TO LEVERAGE EMBEDDINGS FROM OTHER DOMAINS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
ADDI: RECOMMENDING ALTERNATIVES FOR DRUG-DRUG INTERACTIONS WITH NEGATIVE HEALTH EFFECTS. INVESTIGATING THE INTERACTIONS AMONG VARIOUS DRUGS IS AN INDISPENSABLE ISSUE IN THE FIELD OF COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY. SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE REPRESENTS A RICH SOURCE FOR THE RETRIEVAL OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN DRUGS. PREDICTING DRUG-DRUG INTERACTION (DDI) TYPES WILL HELP BIOLOGISTS TO EVADE HAZARDOUS DRUG INTERACTIONS AND SUPPORT THEM IN DISCOVERING POTENTIAL ALTERNATIVES THAT INCREASE THERAPEUTIC EFFICACY AND REDUCE TOXICITY. IN THIS PAPER, WE PROPOSE A GENERAL-PURPOSE METHOD CALLED ADDI (STANDING FOR ALTERNATIVE DRUG-DRUG INTERACTION) THAT APPLIES DEEP LEARNING ON PUBMED ABSTRACTS TO PREDICT INTERACTION TYPES AMONG DRUGS. AS AN APPLICATION, ADDI RECOMMENDS ALTERNATIVES FOR DRUG-DRUG INTERACTIONS (DDIS) WHICH HAVE NEGATIVE HEALTH EFFECTS TYPES (NHETS). ADDI CLEARLY OUTPERFORMS STATE-OF-THE-ART METHODS, ON AVERAGE BY 13%, WITH RESPECT TO ACCURACY BY USING ONLY THE TEXTUAL CONTENT OF THE ONLINE PUBMED PAPERS.

ADVERSE DRUG EVENT AND MEDICATION EXTRACTION IN ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS VIA A CASCADING ARCHITECTURE WITH DIFFERENT SEQUENCE LABELING MODELS AND WORD EMBEDDINGS. OBJECTIVE: AN ADVERSE DRUG EVENT (ADE) REFERS TO AN INJURY RESULTING FROM MEDICAL INTERVENTION RELATED TO A DRUG INCLUDING HARM CAUSED BY DRUGS OR FROM THE USAGE OF DRUGS. EXTRACTING ADES FROM CLINICAL RECORDS CAN HELP PHYSICIANS ASSOCIATE ADVERSE EVENTS TO TARGETED DRUGS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: WE PROPOSED A CASCADING ARCHITECTURE TO RECOGNIZE MEDICAL CONCEPTS INCLUDING ADES, DRUG NAMES, AND ENTITIES RELATED TO DRUGS. THE ARCHITECTURE INCLUDES A PREPROCESSING METHOD AND AN ENSEMBLE OF CONDITIONAL RANDOM FIELDS (CRFS) AND NEURAL NETWORK-BASED MODELS TO RESPECTIVELY ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES OF SURROGATE STRING AND OVERLAPPING ANNOTATION BOUNDARIES OBSERVED IN THE EMPLOYED ADES AND MEDICATION EXTRACTION (ADME) CORPUS. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF APPLYING DIFFERENT PRETRAINED AND POSTPROCESSED WORD EMBEDDINGS FOR THE ADME TASK WAS ALSO STUDIED. RESULTS: THE EMPIRICAL RESULTS SHOWED THAT BOTH CRFS AND NEURAL NETWORK-BASED MODELS PROVIDE PROMISING SOLUTION FOR THE ADME TASK. THE NEURAL NETWORK-BASED MODELS PARTICULARLY OUTPERFORMED CRFS IN CONCEPT TYPES INVOLVING NARRATIVE DESCRIPTIONS. OUR BEST RUN ACHIEVED AN OVERALL MICRO F-SCORE OF 0.919 ON THE EMPLOYED CORPUS. OUR RESULTS ALSO SUGGESTED THAT THE GLOBAL VECTORS FOR WORD REPRESENTATION EMBEDDING IN GENERAL DOMAIN PROVIDES A VERY STRONG BASELINE, WHICH CAN BE FURTHER IMPROVED BY APPLYING THE PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS TO GENERATE MORE ISOTROPIC VECTORS. CONCLUSIONS: WE HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT THE PROPOSED CASCADING ARCHITECTURE CAN HANDLE THE PROBLEM OF OVERLAPPED ANNOTATIONS AND FURTHER IMPROVE THE OVERALL RECALL AND F-SCORES BECAUSE THE ARCHITECTURE ENABLES THE DEVELOPED MODELS TO EXPLOIT MORE CONTEXT INFORMATION AND FORMS AN ENSEMBLE FOR CREATING A STRONGER RECOGNIZER.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
ADVERSE DRUG EVENT DETECTION FROM ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS USING HIERARCHICAL RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORKS WITH DUAL-LEVEL EMBEDDING. INTRODUCTION: ADVERSE DRUG EVENT (ADE) DETECTION IS A VITAL STEP TOWARDS EFFECTIVE PHARMACOVIGILANCE AND PREVENTION OF FUTURE INCIDENTS CAUSED BY POTENTIALLY HARMFUL ADES. THE ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS (EHRS) OF PATIENTS IN HOSPITALS CONTAIN VALUABLE INFORMATION REGARDING ADES AND HENCE ARE AN IMPORTANT SOURCE FOR DETECTING ADE SIGNALS. HOWEVER, EHR TEXTS TEND TO BE NOISY. YET APPLYING OFF-THE-SHELF TOOLS FOR EHR TEXT PREPROCESSING JEOPARDIZES THE SUBSEQUENT ADE DETECTION PERFORMANCE, WHICH DEPENDS ON A WELL TOKENIZED TEXT INPUT. OBJECTIVE: IN THIS PAPER, WE REPORT OUR EXPERIENCE WITH THE NLP CHALLENGES FOR DETECTING MEDICATION AND ADVERSE DRUG EVENTS FROM ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS (MADE1.0), WHICH AIMS TO PROMOTE DEEP INNOVATIONS ON THIS SUBJECT. IN PARTICULAR, WE HAVE DEVELOPED RULE-BASED SENTENCE AND WORD TOKENIZATION TECHNIQUES TO DEAL WITH THE NOISE IN THE EHR TEXT. METHODS: WE PROPOSE A DETECTION METHODOLOGY BY ADAPTING A THREE-LAYERED, DEEP LEARNING ARCHITECTURE OF (1) RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORK [BI-DIRECTIONAL LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY (BI-LSTM)] FOR CHARACTER-LEVEL WORD REPRESENTATION TO ENCODE THE MORPHOLOGICAL FEATURES OF THE MEDICAL TERMINOLOGY, (2) BI-LSTM FOR CAPTURING THE CONTEXTUAL INFORMATION OF EACH WORD WITHIN A SENTENCE, AND (3) CONDITIONAL RANDOM FIELDS FOR THE FINAL LABEL PREDICTION BY ALSO CONSIDERING THE SURROUNDING WORDS. WE EXPERIMENT WITH DIFFERENT WORD EMBEDDING METHODS COMMONLY USED IN WORD-LEVEL CLASSIFICATION TASKS AND DEMONSTRATE THE IMPACT OF AN INTEGRATED USAGE OF BOTH DOMAIN-SPECIFIC AND GENERAL-PURPOSE PRE-TRAINED WORD EMBEDDING FOR DETECTING ADES FROM EHRS. RESULTS: OUR SYSTEM WAS RANKED FIRST FOR THE NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION TASK IN THE MADE1.0 CHALLENGE, WITH A MICRO-AVERAGED F1-SCORE OF 0.8290 (OFFICIAL SCORE). CONCLUSION: OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE INTEGRATION OF TWO WIDELY USED SEQUENCE LABELING TECHNIQUES THAT COMPLEMENT EACH OTHER ALONG WITH DUAL-LEVEL EMBEDDING (CHARACTER LEVEL AND WORD LEVEL) TO REPRESENT WORDS IN THE INPUT LAYER RESULTS IN A DEEP LEARNING ARCHITECTURE THAT ACHIEVES EXCELLENT INFORMATION EXTRACTION ACCURACY FOR EHR NOTES.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
AENET: AN ATTENTION-ENABLED NEURAL ARCHITECTURE FOR FAKE NEWS DETECTION USING CONTEXTUAL FEATURES. IN THE CURRENT ERA OF SOCIAL MEDIA, THE POPULARITY OF SMARTPHONES AND SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS HAS INCREASED EXPONENTIALLY. THROUGH THESE ELECTRONIC MEDIA, FAKE NEWS HAS BEEN RISING RAPIDLY WITH THE ADVENT OF NEW SOURCES OF INFORMATION, WHICH ARE HIGHLY UNRELIABLE. CHECKING OFF A PARTICULAR NEWS ARTICLE IS GENUINE OR FAKE IS NOT EASY FOR ANY END USER. SEARCH ENGINES LIKE GOOGLE ARE ALSO NOT CAPABLE OF TELLING ABOUT THE FAKENESS OF ANY NEWS ARTICLE DUE TO ITS RESTRICTION WITH LIMITED QUERY KEYWORDS. IN THIS PAPER, OUR END GOAL IS TO DESIGN AN EFFICIENT DEEP LEARNING MODEL TO DETECT THE DEGREE OF FAKENESS IN A NEWS STATEMENT. WE PROPOSE A SIMPLE NETWORK ARCHITECTURE THAT COMBINES THE USE OF CONTEXTUAL EMBEDDING AS WORD EMBEDDING AND USES ATTENTION MECHANISMS WITH RELEVANT METADATA AVAILABLE. THE EFFICACY AND EFFICIENCY OF OUR MODELS ARE DEMONSTRATED ON SEVERAL REAL-WORLD DATASETS. OUR MODEL ACHIEVED 46.36% ACCURACY ON THE LIAR DATASET, WHICH OUTPERFORMS THE CURRENT STATE OF THE ART BY 1.49%.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
AGENT-BASED SEMANTIC ROLE MINING FOR INTELLIGENT ACCESS CONTROL IN MULTI-DOMAIN COLLABORATIVE APPLICATIONS OF SMART CITIES. SIGNIFICANCE AND POPULARITY OF ROLE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL (RBAC) IS INEVITABLE; HOWEVER, ITS APPLICATION IS HIGHLY CHALLENGING IN MULTI-DOMAIN COLLABORATIVE SMART CITY ENVIRONMENTS. THE REASON IS ITS LIMITATIONS IN ADAPTING THE DYNAMICALLY CHANGING INFORMATION OF USERS, TASKS, ACCESS POLICIES AND RESOURCES IN SUCH APPLICATIONS. IT ALSO DOES NOT INCORPORATE SEMANTICALLY MEANINGFUL BUSINESS ROLES, WHICH COULD HAVE A DIVERSE IMPACT UPON ACCESS DECISIONS IN SUCH MULTI-DOMAIN COLLABORATIVE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENTS. WE PROPOSE AN INTELLIGENT ROLE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL (I-RBAC) MODEL THAT USES INTELLIGENT SOFTWARE AGENTS FOR ACHIEVING INTELLIGENT ACCESS CONTROL IN SUCH HIGHLY DYNAMIC MULTI-DOMAIN ENVIRONMENTS. THE NOVELTY OF THIS MODEL LIES IN USING A CORE I-RBAC ONTOLOGY THAT IS DEVELOPED USING REAL-WORLD SEMANTIC BUSINESS ROLES AS OCCUPATIONAL ROLES PROVIDED BY STANDARD OCCUPATIONAL CLASSIFICATION (SOC), USA. IT CONTAINS AROUND 1400 BUSINESS ROLES, FROM NEARLY ALL DOMAINS, ALONG WITH THEIR DETAILED TASK DESCRIPTIONS AS WELL AS HIERARCHICAL RELATIONSHIPS AMONG THEM. THE SEMANTIC ROLE MINING PROCESS IS PERFORMED THROUGH INTELLIGENT AGENTS THAT USE WORD EMBEDDING AND A BIDIRECTIONAL LSTM DEEP NEURAL NETWORK FOR AUTOMATED POPULATION OF ORGANIZATIONAL ONTOLOGY FROM ITS UNSTRUCTURED TEXT POLICY AND, SUBSEQUENTLY, MATCHING THIS ONTOLOGY WITH CORE I-RBAC ONTOLOGY TO EXTRACT UNIFIED BUSINESS ROLES. THE EXPERIMENTATION WAS PERFORMED ON A LARGE NUMBER OF COLLABORATION CASE SCENARIOS OF FIVE MULTI-DOMAIN ORGANIZATIONS AND PROMISING RESULTS WERE OBTAINED REGARDING THE ACCURACY OF AUTOMATICALLY DERIVED RDF TRIPLES (SUBJECT, PREDICATE, OBJECT) FROM ORGANIZATIONAL TEXT POLICIES AS WELL AS THE ACCURACY OF EXTRACTED SEMANTICALLY MEANINGFUL ROLES.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
ALLOPHONIC FAMILIARITY DIFFERENTIATES WORD REPRESENTATIONS IN THE BRAIN OF NATIVE SPEAKERS OF REGIONAL LINGUISTIC VARIETIES. THIS STUDY AIMS TO SHED LIGHT ON THE ISSUE WHETHER FAMILIAR ALLOPHONIC VARIATION IS ENCODED IN WORD REPRESENTATIONS. BOTH ITALIAN SPEAKERS BORN IN TRENTINO AND SPEAKERS BORN IN THE CENTRAL-SOUTHERN REGIONS OF ITALY TOOK PART IN THE EXPERIMENT. WE TESTED THE MMN ELICITED BY THE SAME WORD ENCOMPASSING TWO DIFFERENT ALLOPHONES, ONE OF WHICH WAS MORE FAMILIAR TO ONE GROUP OF PARTICIPANTS THAN TO THE OTHER, DEPENDING ON THEIR REGIONAL VARIETY OF ITALIAN. THE TRENTINO GROUP SHOWED AN ENHANCED MMN FOR THE WORD EMBEDDING THE FAMILIAR VARIANT WHILE CENTRAL-SOUTHERN SPEAKERS SHOWED NO DIFFERENCE. THE AMPLITUDE OF THE MMN FOR THE UNFAMILIAR WORD VARIANT IN TRENTINO SPEAKERS SHOWED AN INVERSE CORRELATION WITH THE PASSIVE EXPOSURE TO THE TRENTINO DIALECT. WE CONCLUDE THAT WORDS EMBEDDING FAMILIAR AND UNFAMILIAR ALLOPHONES ARE DIFFERENTLY REPRESENTED IN THE BRAIN OF NATIVE SPEAKERS OF REGIONAL LANGUAGE AND THE DEGREE OF DIFFERENTIATION IS MODULATED BY INDIVIDUAL EXPERIENCE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
AN AI APPROACH FOR IDENTIFYING PATIENTS WITH CIRRHOSIS. GOAL: THE GOAL OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE AN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE APPROACH, NAMELY DEEP LEARNING, ON CLINICAL TEXT IN ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS (EHRS) TO IDENTIFY PATIENTS WITH CIRRHOSIS. BACKGROUND AND AIMS: ACCURATE IDENTIFICATION OF CIRRHOSIS IN EHR IS IMPORTANT FOR EPIDEMIOLOGICAL, HEALTH SERVICES, AND OUTCOMES RESEARCH. CURRENTLY, SUCH EFFORTS DEPEND ON INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASES (ICD) CODES, WITH LIMITED SUCCESS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: WE TRAINED SEVERAL MACHINE LEARNING MODELS USING DISCHARGE SUMMARIES FROM PATIENTS WITH KNOWN CIRRHOSIS FROM A PATIENT REGISTRY AND RANDOM CONTROLS WITHOUT CIRRHOSIS OR ITS COMPLICATIONS BASED ON ICD CODES. MODELS WERE VALIDATED ON PATIENTS FOR WHOM DISCHARGE SUMMARIES WERE MANUALLY REVIEWED AND USED AS THE GOLD STANDARD TEST SET. WE TESTED NAIVE BAYES AND RANDOM FOREST AS BASELINE MODELS AND A DEEP LEARNING MODEL USING WORD EMBEDDING AND A CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (CNN). RESULTS: THE TRAINING SET INCLUDED 446 CIRRHOSIS PATIENTS AND 689 CONTROLS, WHILE THE GOLD STANDARD TEST SET INCLUDED 139 CIRRHOSIS PATIENTS AND 152 CONTROLS. AMONG THE MACHINE LEARNING MODELS, THE CNN ACHIEVED THE HIGHEST AREA UNDER THE RECEIVER OPERATING CHARACTERISTIC CURVE (0.993), WITH A PRECISION OF 0.965 AND RECALL OF 0.978, COMPARED WITH 0.879 AND 0.981 FOR THE NAIVE BAYES AND RANDOM FOREST, RESPECTIVELY (PRECISION 0.787 AND 0.958, AND RECALLS 0.878 AND 0.827). THE PRECISION BY ICD CODES FOR CIRRHOSIS WAS 0.883 AND RECALL WAS 0.978. CONCLUSIONS: A CNN MODEL TRAINED ON DISCHARGE SUMMARIES IDENTIFIED CIRRHOSIS PATIENTS WITH HIGH PRECISION AND RECALL. THIS APPROACH FOR PHENOTYPING CIRRHOSIS IN THE EHR MAY PROVIDE A MORE ACCURATE ASSESSMENT OF DISEASE BURDEN IN A VARIETY OF STUDIES.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
AN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE APPROACH TO COVID-19 INFECTION RISK ASSESSMENT IN VIRTUAL VISITS: A CASE REPORT. OBJECTIVE: IN AN EFFORT TO IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY OF COMPUTER ALGORITHMS APPLIED TO SCREENING FOR CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 2019 (COVID-19) TESTING, WE USED NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE-BASED METHODS WITH UNSTRUCTURED PATIENT DATA COLLECTED THROUGH TELEHEALTH VISITS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: AFTER SEGMENTING AND PARSING DOCUMENTS, WE CONDUCTED ANALYSIS OF OVERREPRESENTED WORDS IN PATIENT SYMPTOMS. WE THEN DEVELOPED A WORD EMBEDDING-BASED CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK FOR PREDICTING COVID-19 TEST RESULTS BASED ON PATIENTS' SELF-REPORTED SYMPTOMS. RESULTS: TEXT ANALYTICS REVEALED THAT CONCEPTS SUCH AS SMELL AND TASTE WERE MORE PREVALENT THAN EXPECTED IN PATIENTS TESTING POSITIVE. AS A RESULT, SCREENING ALGORITHMS WERE ADAPTED TO INCLUDE THESE SYMPTOMS. THE DEEP LEARNING MODEL YIELDED AN AREA UNDER THE RECEIVER-OPERATING CHARACTERISTIC CURVE OF 0.729 FOR PREDICTING POSITIVE RESULTS AND WAS SUBSEQUENTLY APPLIED TO PRIORITIZE TESTING APPOINTMENT SCHEDULING. CONCLUSIONS: INFORMATICS TOOLS SUCH AS NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE METHODS CAN HAVE SIGNIFICANT CLINICAL IMPACTS WHEN APPLIED TO DATA STREAMS EARLY IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF CLINICAL SYSTEMS FOR OUTBREAK RESPONSE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
AN ATTENTION-BASED EFFECTIVE NEURAL MODEL FOR DRUG-DRUG INTERACTIONS EXTRACTION. BACKGROUND: DRUG-DRUG INTERACTIONS (DDIS) OFTEN BRING UNEXPECTED SIDE EFFECTS. THE CLINICAL RECOGNITION OF DDIS IS A CRUCIAL ISSUE FOR BOTH PATIENT SAFETY AND HEALTHCARE COST CONTROL. HOWEVER, ALTHOUGH TEXT-MINING-BASED SYSTEMS EXPLORE VARIOUS METHODS TO CLASSIFY DDIS, THE CLASSIFICATION PERFORMANCE WITH REGARD TO DDIS IN LONG AND COMPLEX SENTENCES IS STILL UNSATISFACTORY. METHODS: IN THIS STUDY, WE PROPOSE AN EFFECTIVE MODEL THAT CLASSIFIES DDIS FROM THE LITERATURE BY COMBINING AN ATTENTION MECHANISM AND A RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORK WITH LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY (LSTM) UNITS. IN OUR APPROACH, FIRST, A CANDIDATE-DRUG-ORIENTED INPUT ATTENTION ACTING ON WORD-EMBEDDING VECTORS AUTOMATICALLY LEARNS WHICH WORDS ARE MORE INFLUENTIAL FOR A GIVEN DRUG PAIR. NEXT, THE INPUTS MERGING THE POSITION- AND POS-EMBEDDING VECTORS ARE PASSED TO A BIDIRECTIONAL LSTM LAYER WHOSE OUTPUTS AT THE LAST TIME STEP REPRESENT THE HIGH-LEVEL SEMANTIC INFORMATION OF THE WHOLE SENTENCE. FINALLY, A SOFTMAX LAYER PERFORMS DDI CLASSIFICATION. RESULTS: EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS FROM THE DDIEXTRACTION 2013 CORPUS SHOW THAT OUR SYSTEM PERFORMS THE BEST WITH RESPECT TO DETECTION AND CLASSIFICATION (84.0% AND 77.3%, RESPECTIVELY) COMPARED WITH OTHER STATE-OF-THE-ART METHODS. IN PARTICULAR, FOR THE MEDLINE-2013 DATASET WITH LONG AND COMPLEX SENTENCES, OUR F-SCORE FAR EXCEEDS THOSE OF TOP-RANKING SYSTEMS BY 12.6%. CONCLUSIONS: OUR APPROACH EFFECTIVELY IMPROVES THE PERFORMANCE OF DDI CLASSIFICATION TASKS. EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSIS DEMONSTRATES THAT OUR MODEL PERFORMS BETTER WITH RESPECT TO RECOGNIZING NOT ONLY CLOSE-RANGE BUT ALSO LONG-RANGE PATTERNS AMONG WORDS, ESPECIALLY FOR LONG, COMPLEX AND COMPOUND SENTENCES.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
AN AUTOMATED METHOD TO ENRICH CONSUMER HEALTH VOCABULARIES USING GLOVE WORD EMBEDDINGS AND AN AUXILIARY LEXICAL RESOURCE. BACKGROUND: CLEAR LANGUAGE MAKES COMMUNICATION EASIER BETWEEN ANY TWO PARTIES. A LAYMAN MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY COMMUNICATING WITH A PROFESSIONAL DUE TO NOT UNDERSTANDING THE SPECIALIZED TERMS COMMON TO THE DOMAIN. IN HEALTHCARE, IT IS RARE TO FIND A LAYMAN KNOWLEDGEABLE IN MEDICAL TERMINOLOGY WHICH CAN LEAD TO POOR UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR CONDITION AND/OR TREATMENT. TO BRIDGE THIS GAP, SEVERAL PROFESSIONAL VOCABULARIES AND ONTOLOGIES HAVE BEEN CREATED TO MAP LAYMEN MEDICAL TERMS TO PROFESSIONAL MEDICAL TERMS AND VICE VERSA. OBJECTIVE: MANY OF THE PRESENTED VOCABULARIES ARE BUILT MANUALLY OR SEMI-AUTOMATICALLY REQUIRING LARGE INVESTMENTS OF TIME AND HUMAN EFFORT AND CONSEQUENTLY THE SLOW GROWTH OF THESE VOCABULARIES. IN THIS PAPER, WE PRESENT AN AUTOMATIC METHOD TO ENRICH LAYMEN'S VOCABULARIES THAT HAS THE BENEFIT OF BEING ABLE TO BE APPLIED TO VOCABULARIES IN ANY DOMAIN. METHODS: OUR ENTIRELY AUTOMATIC APPROACH USES MACHINE LEARNING, SPECIFICALLY GLOBAL VECTORS FOR WORD EMBEDDINGS (GLOVE), ON A CORPUS COLLECTED FROM A SOCIAL MEDIA HEALTHCARE PLATFORM TO EXTEND AND ENHANCE CONSUMER HEALTH VOCABULARIES. OUR APPROACH FURTHER IMPROVES THE CONSUMER HEALTH VOCABULARIES BY INCORPORATING SYNONYMS AND HYPONYMS FROM THE WORDNET ONTOLOGY. THE BASIC GLOVE AND OUR NOVEL ALGORITHMS INCORPORATING WORDNET WERE EVALUATED USING TWO LAYMEN DATASETS FROM THE NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE (NLM), OPEN-ACCESS CONSUMER HEALTH VOCABULARY (OAC CHV) AND MEDLINEPLUS HEALTHCARE VOCABULARY. RESULTS: THE RESULTS SHOW THAT GLOVE WAS ABLE TO FIND NEW LAYMEN TERMS WITH AN F-SCORE OF 48.44%. FURTHERMORE, OUR ENHANCED GLOVE APPROACH OUTPERFORMED BASIC GLOVE WITH AN AVERAGE F-SCORE OF 61%, A RELATIVE IMPROVEMENT OF 25%. FURTHERMORE, THE ENHANCED GLOVE SHOWED A STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE OVER THE TWO GROUND TRUTH DATASETS WITH P < 0.001. CONCLUSIONS: THIS PAPER PRESENTS AN AUTOMATIC APPROACH TO ENRICH CONSUMER HEALTH VOCABULARIES USING THE GLOVE WORD EMBEDDINGS AND AN AUXILIARY LEXICAL SOURCE, WORDNET. OUR APPROACH WAS EVALUATED USED HEALTHCARE TEXT DOWNLOADED FROM MEDHELP.ORG, A HEALTHCARE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM USING TWO STANDARD LAYMEN VOCABULARIES, OAC CHV, AND MEDLINEPLUS. WE USED THE WORDNET ONTOLOGY TO EXPAND THE HEALTHCARE CORPUS BY INCLUDING SYNONYMS, HYPONYMS, AND HYPERNYMS FOR EACH LAYMAN TERM OCCURRENCE IN THE CORPUS. GIVEN A SEED TERM SELECTED FROM A CONCEPT IN THE ONTOLOGY, WE MEASURED OUR ALGORITHMS' ABILITY TO AUTOMATICALLY EXTRACT SYNONYMS FOR THOSE TERMS THAT APPEARED IN THE GROUND TRUTH CONCEPT. WE FOUND THAT ENHANCED GLOVE OUTPERFORMED GLOVE WITH A RELATIVE IMPROVEMENT OF 25% IN THE F-SCORE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
AN AUTOMATED TOXICITY CLASSIFICATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA USING LSTM AND WORD EMBEDDING. THE AUTOMATED IDENTIFICATION OF TOXICITY IN TEXTS IS A CRUCIAL AREA IN TEXT ANALYSIS SINCE THE SOCIAL MEDIA WORLD IS REPLETE WITH UNFILTERED CONTENT THAT RANGES FROM MILDLY ABUSIVE TO DOWNRIGHT HATEFUL. RESEARCHERS HAVE FOUND AN UNINTENDED BIAS AND UNFAIRNESS CAUSED BY TRAINING DATASETS, WHICH CAUSED AN INACCURATE CLASSIFICATION OF TOXIC WORDS IN CONTEXT. IN THIS PAPER, SEVERAL APPROACHES FOR LOCATING TOXICITY IN TEXTS ARE ASSESSED AND PRESENTED AIMING TO ENHANCE THE OVERALL QUALITY OF TEXT CLASSIFICATION. GENERAL UNSUPERVISED METHODS WERE USED DEPENDING ON THE STATE-OF-ART MODELS AND EXTERNAL EMBEDDINGS TO IMPROVE THE ACCURACY WHILE RELIEVING BIAS AND ENHANCING F1-SCORE. SUGGESTED APPROACHES USED A COMBINATION OF LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY (LSTM) DEEP LEARNING MODEL WITH GLOVE WORD EMBEDDINGS AND LSTM WITH WORD EMBEDDINGS GENERATED BY THE BIDIRECTIONAL ENCODER REPRESENTATIONS FROM TRANSFORMERS (BERT), RESPECTIVELY. THESE MODELS WERE TRAINED AND TESTED ON LARGE SECONDARY QUALITATIVE DATA CONTAINING A LARGE NUMBER OF COMMENTS CLASSIFIED AS TOXIC OR NOT. RESULTS FOUND THAT ACCEPTABLE ACCURACY OF 94% AND AN F1-SCORE OF 0.89 WERE ACHIEVED USING LSTM WITH BERT WORD EMBEDDINGS IN THE BINARY CLASSIFICATION OF COMMENTS (TOXIC AND NONTOXIC). A COMBINATION OF LSTM AND BERT PERFORMED BETTER THAN BOTH LSTM UNACCOMPANIED AND LSTM WITH GLOVE WORD EMBEDDING. THIS PAPER TRIES TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF CLASSIFYING COMMENTS WITH HIGH ACCURACY BY PERTAINING MODELS WITH LARGER CORPORA OF TEXT (HIGH-QUALITY WORD EMBEDDING) RATHER THAN THE TRAINING DATA SOLELY.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
AN EFFECTIVE SKIN CANCER CLASSIFICATION MECHANISM VIA MEDICAL VISION TRANSFORMER. SKIN CANCER (SC) IS CONSIDERED THE DEADLIEST DISEASE IN THE WORLD, KILLING THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE EVERY YEAR. EARLY SC DETECTION CAN INCREASE THE SURVIVAL RATE FOR PATIENTS UP TO 70%, HENCE IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED THAT REGULAR HEAD-TO-TOE SKIN EXAMINATIONS ARE CONDUCTED TO DETERMINE WHETHER THERE ARE ANY SIGNS OR SYMPTOMS OF SC. THE USE OF MACHINE LEARNING (ML)-BASED METHODS IS HAVING A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE CLASSIFICATION AND DETECTION OF SC DISEASES. HOWEVER, THERE ARE CERTAIN CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE ACCURATE CLASSIFICATION OF THESE DISEASES SUCH AS A LOWER DETECTION ACCURACY, POOR GENERALIZATION OF THE MODELS, AND AN INSUFFICIENT AMOUNT OF LABELED DATA FOR TRAINING. TO ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES, IN THIS WORK WE DEVELOPED A TWO-TIER FRAMEWORK FOR THE ACCURATE CLASSIFICATION OF SC. DURING THE FIRST STAGE OF THE FRAMEWORK, WE APPLIED DIFFERENT METHODS FOR DATA AUGMENTATION TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF IMAGE SAMPLES FOR EFFECTIVE TRAINING. AS PART OF THE SECOND TIER OF THE FRAMEWORK, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE PROMISING PERFORMANCE OF THE MEDICAL VISION TRANSFORMER (MVT) IN THE ANALYSIS OF MEDICAL IMAGES, WE DEVELOPED AN MVT-BASED CLASSIFICATION MODEL FOR SC. THIS MVT SPLITS THE INPUT IMAGE INTO IMAGE PATCHES AND THEN FEEDS THESE PATCHES TO THE TRANSFORMER IN A SEQUENCE STRUCTURE, LIKE WORD EMBEDDING. FINALLY, MULTI-LAYER PERCEPTRON (MLP) IS USED TO CLASSIFY THE INPUT IMAGE INTO THE CORRESPONDING CLASS. BASED ON THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS ACHIEVED ON THE HUMAN AGAINST MACHINE (HAM10000) DATASETS, WE CONCLUDED THAT THE PROPOSED MVT-BASED MODEL ACHIEVES BETTER RESULTS THAN CURRENT STATE-OF-THE-ART TECHNIQUES FOR SC CLASSIFICATION.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
AN ENSEMBLE DEEP LEARNING CLASSIFIER FOR SENTIMENT ANALYSIS ON CODE-MIX HINDI-ENGLISH DATA. CODE-MIXING ON SOCIAL MEDIA IS A TREND IN MANY COUNTRIES WHERE PEOPLE SPEAK MULTIPLE LANGUAGES, SUCH AS INDIA, WHERE HINDI AND ENGLISH ARE MAJOR COMMUNICATION LANGUAGES. SENTIMENT ANALYSIS IS BENEFICIAL IN UNDERSTANDING USERS' OPINIONS AND THOUGHTS ON SOCIAL, ECONOMIC, AND POLITICAL ISSUES. IT ELIMINATES THE MANUAL MONITORING OF EACH AND EVERY REVIEW, WHICH IS A CUMBERSOME TASK. HOWEVER, PERFORMING SENTIMENT ANALYSIS ON CODE-MIX DATA IS CHALLENGING, AS IT INVOLVES VARIOUS OUT OF VOCABULARY TERMS AND NUMEROUS ISSUES, MAKING IT A NEW FIELD IN NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING. THIS WORK INCLUDES DEALING WITH SUCH TEXT AND ENSEMBLING A CLASSIFIER TO DETECT SENTIMENT POLARITY. OUR CLASSIFIER ENSEMBLES A MULTILINGUAL VARIANT OF ROBERTA AND A SENTENCE-LEVEL EMBEDDING FROM UNIVERSAL SENTENCE ENCODER TO IDENTIFY THE SENTIMENTS OF THESE CODE-MIXED TWEETS WITH HIGHER ACCURACY. THIS ENSEMBLE OPTIMISES THE CLASSIFIER'S PERFORMANCE BY USING THE STRENGTH OF BOTH FOR TRANSFER LEARNING. EXPERIMENTS WERE CONDUCTED ON REAL-LIFE BENCHMARK DATASETS AND REVEALED THEIR SENTIMENT. THE PERFORMANCE OF THE PROPOSED CLASSIFIER FRAMEWORK IS COMPARED WITH OTHER BASELINES AND DEEP LEARNING MODELS ON FIVE DATASETS TO SHOW THE SUPERIORITY OF OUR RESULTS. RESULTS SHOWED IMPROVED AND INCREASED PERFORMANCE IN THE PROPOSED CLASSIFIER'S ACCURACY, PRECISION, AND RECALL. THE ACCURACY ACHIEVED BY OUR CLASSIFIER ON CODE-MIX DATASETS IS 66% ON JOSHI ET AL. 2016, 60% ON SAIL 2017, AND 67% ON SEMEVAL 2020 TASK-9 DATASET, WHICH IS ON AVERAGE AROUND 3% AS COMPARED TO CONTEMPORARY BASELINES.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
AN ENSEMBLE SEMANTIC TEXTUAL SIMILARITY MEASURE BASED ON MULTIPLE EVIDENCES FOR BIOMEDICAL DOCUMENTS. WITH THE INCREASING VOLUME OF THE PUBLISHED BIOMEDICAL LITERATURE, THE FAST AND EFFECTIVE RETRIEVAL OF THE LITERATURE ON THE SEQUENCE, STRUCTURE, AND FUNCTION OF BIOLOGICAL ENTITIES IS AN ESSENTIAL TASK FOR THE RAPID DEVELOPMENT OF BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE. TO CAPTURE THE SEMANTIC INFORMATION IN BIOMEDICAL LITERATURE MORE EFFECTIVELY WHEN BIOMEDICAL DOCUMENTS ARE CLUSTERED, WE PROPOSE A NEW MULTI-EVIDENCE-BASED SEMANTIC TEXT SIMILARITY CALCULATION METHOD. TWO SEMANTIC SIMILARITIES AND ONE CONTENT SIMILARITY ARE USED, IN WHICH TWO SEMANTIC SIMILARITIES INCLUDE MESH-BASED SEMANTIC SIMILARITY AND WORD EMBEDDING-BASED SEMANTIC SIMILARITY. TO FUSE THREE DIFFERENT SIMILARITIES MORE EFFECTIVELY, AFTER, RESPECTIVELY, CALCULATING TWO SEMANTIC AND ONE CONTENT SIMILARITIES BETWEEN BIOMEDICAL DOCUMENTS, FEEDFORWARD NEURAL NETWORK IS APPLIED TO INTEGRATE THE TWO SEMANTIC SIMILARITIES. FINALLY, WEIGHTED LINEAR COMBINATION METHOD IS USED TO INTEGRATE THE SEMANTIC AND CONTENT SIMILARITIES. TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS, THE PROPOSED METHOD IS COMPARED WITH THE EXISTING BASIC METHODS, AND THE PROPOSED METHOD OUTPERFORMS THE EXISTING RELATED METHODS. BASED ON THE PROVEN RESULTS OF THIS STUDY, THIS METHOD CAN BE USED NOT ONLY IN ACTUAL BIOLOGICAL OR MEDICAL EXPERIMENTS SUCH AS PROTEIN SEQUENCE OR FUNCTION ANALYSIS BUT ALSO IN BIOLOGICAL AND MEDICAL RESEARCH FIELDS, WHICH WILL HELP TO PROVIDE, USE, AND UNDERSTAND THEMATICALLY CONSISTENT DOCUMENTS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE DEEP LEARNING APPROACH IN SENTIMENTAL ANALYSIS USING GRAPH-BASED THEORIES. SENTIMENT ANALYSIS IS A BRANCH OF NATURAL LANGUAGE ANALYTICS THAT AIMS TO CORRELATE WHAT IS EXPRESSED WHICH COMES NORMALLY WITHIN UNSTRUCTURED FORMAT WITH WHAT IS BELIEVED AND LEARNT. SEVERAL ATTEMPTS HAVE TRIED TO ADDRESS THIS GAP (I.E., NAIVE BAYES, RNN, LSTM, WORD EMBEDDING, ETC.), EVEN THOUGH THE DEEP LEARNING MODELS ACHIEVED HIGH PERFORMANCE, THEIR GENERATIVE PROCESS REMAINS A "BLACK-BOX" AND NOT FULLY DISCLOSED DUE TO THE HIGH DIMENSIONAL FEATURE AND THE NON-DETERMINISTIC WEIGHTS ASSIGNMENT. MEANWHILE, GRAPHS ARE BECOMING MORE POPULAR WHEN MODELING COMPLEX SYSTEMS WHILE BEING TRACEABLE AND UNDERSTOOD. HERE, WE REVEAL THAT A GOOD TRADE-OFF TRANSPARENCY AND EFFICIENCY COULD BE ACHIEVED WITH A DEEP NEURAL NETWORK BY EXPLORING THE CREDIT ASSIGNMENT PATHS THEORY. TO THIS END, WE PROPOSE A NOVEL ALGORITHM WHICH ALLEVIATES THE FEATURES' EXTRACTION MECHANISM AND ATTRIBUTES AN IMPORTANCE LEVEL OF SELECTED NEURONS BY APPLYING A DETERMINISTIC EDGE/NODE EMBEDDINGS WITH ATTENTION SCORES ON THE INPUT UNIT AND BACKWARD PATH RESPECTIVELY. WE EXPERIMENT ON THE TWITTER HEALTH NEWS DATASET WERE THE MODEL HAS BEEN EXTENDED TO APPROACH DIFFERENT APPROXIMATIONS (TWEET/ASPECT AND TWEETS' SOURCE LEVELS, FREQUENCY, POLARITY/SUBJECTIVITY), IT WAS ALSO TRANSPARENT AND TRACEABLE. MOREOVER, RESULTS OF COMPARING WITH FOUR RECENT MODELS ON SAME DATA CORPUS FOR TWEETS ANALYSIS SHOWED A RAPID CONVERGENCE WITH AN OVERALL ACCURACY OF APPROXIMATELY 83% AND 94% OF CORRECTLY IDENTIFIED TRUE POSITIVE SENTIMENTS. THEREFORE, WEIGHTS CAN BE IDEALLY ASSIGNED TO SPECIFIC ACTIVE FEATURES BY FOLLOWING THE PROPOSED METHOD. AS OPPOSITE TO OTHER COMPARED WORKS, THE INFERRED FEATURES ARE CONDITIONED THROUGH THE USERS' PREFERENCES (I.E., FREQUENCY DEGREE) AND VIA THE ACTIVATION'S DERIVATIVES (I.E., REJECT FEATURE IF NOT SCORED). FUTURE DIRECTION WILL ADDRESS THE INDUCTIVE ASPECT OF GRAPH EMBEDDINGS TO INCLUDE DYNAMIC GRAPH STRUCTURES AND EXPAND THE MODEL RESILIENCY BY CONSIDERING OTHER DATASETS LIKE SEMEVAL TASK7, COVID-19 TWEETS, ETC.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
ANALYSING HATE SPEECH AGAINST MIGRANTS AND WOMEN THROUGH TWEETS USING ENSEMBLED DEEP LEARNING MODEL. TWITTER'S POPULARITY HAS EXPLODED IN THE PREVIOUS FEW YEARS, MAKING IT ONE OF THE MOST WIDELY USED SOCIAL MEDIA SITES. AS A RESULT OF THIS DEVELOPMENT, THE STRATEGIES DESCRIBED IN THIS STUDY ARE NOW MORE BENEFICIAL. ADDITIONALLY, THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO EXPRESS THEIR VIEWS IN DEMEANING WAYS TO OTHERS. AS A RESULT, HATE SPEECH HAS PIQUED INTEREST IN THE SUBJECT OF SENTIMENT ANALYSIS, WHICH HAS DEVELOPED VARIOUS ALGORITHMS FOR DETECTING EMOTIONS IN SOCIAL NETWORKS USING INTUITIVE MEANS. THIS PAPER PROPOSES THE DEEP LEARNING MODEL TO CLASSIFY THE SENTIMENTS IN TWO SEPARATE ANALYSES. IN THE FIRST ANALYSIS, THE TWEETS ARE CLASSIFIED BASED ON THE HATE SPEECH AGAINST THE MIGRANTS AND THE WOMEN. IN THE SECOND ANALYSIS, THE DETECTION IS PERFORMED USING A DEEP LEARNING MODEL TO ORGANISE WHETHER THE HATE SPEECH IS PERFORMED BY A SINGLE OR A GROUP OF USERS. DURING THE TEXT ANALYSIS, WORD EMBEDDING IS IMPLEMENTED USING THE COMBINATION OF DEEP LEARNING MODELS SUCH AS BILSTM, CNN, AND MLP. THESE MODELS ARE INTEGRATED WITH WORD EMBEDDING METHODS SUCH AS INVERSE GLOVE (GLOBAL VECTOR), DOCUMENT FREQUENCY (TF-IDF), AND TRANSFORMER-BASED EMBEDDING.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
ANALYSIS OF LANGUAGE EMBEDDINGS FOR CLASSIFICATION OF UNSTRUCTURED PATHOLOGY REPORTS. A PATHOLOGY REPORT IS ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT MEDICAL DOCUMENTS PROVIDING INTERPRETIVE INSIGHTS INTO THE VISUAL APPEARANCE OF THE PATIENT'S BIOPSY SAMPLE. IN DIGITAL PATHOLOGY, HIGH-RESOLUTION IMAGES OF TISSUE SAMPLES ARE STORED ALONG WITH PATHOLOGY REPORTS. DESPITE THE VALUABLE INFORMATION THAT PATHOLOGY REPORTS HOLD, THEY ARE NOT USED IN ANY SYSTEMATIC MANNER TO PROMOTE COMPUTATIONAL PATHOLOGY. IN THIS WORK, WE FOCUS ON ANALYZING THE REPORTS, WHICH ARE GENERALLY UNSTRUCTURED DOCUMENTS WRITTEN IN ENGLISH WITH SOPHISTICATED AND HIGHLY SPECIALIZED MEDICAL TERMINOLOGY. WE PROVIDE A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF VARIOUS EMBEDDING MODELS LIKE BIOBERT, CLINICAL BIOBERT, BIOMED-ROBERTA AND TERM FREQUENCY-INVERSE DOCUMENT FREQUENCY (TF-IDF), A TRADITIONAL NLP TECHNIQUE, AS WELL AS THE COMBINATION OF EMBEDDINGS FROM PRE-TRAINED MODELS WITH TF-IDF. OUR RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF VARIOUS WORD EMBEDDING TECHNIQUES FOR PATHOLOGY REPORTS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
ANALYZING THE VACCINATION DEBATE IN SOCIAL MEDIA DATA PRE- AND POST-COVID-19 PANDEMIC. THE COVID-19 VIRUS HAS CAUSED AND CONTINUES TO CAUSE UNPRECEDENTED IMPACTS ON THE LIFE TRAJECTORIES OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE GLOBALLY. RECENTLY, TO COMBAT THE TRANSMISSION OF THE VIRUS, VACCINATION CAMPAIGNS AROUND THE WORLD HAVE BECOME PREVALENT. HOWEVER, WHILE MANY SEE SUCH CAMPAIGNS AS POSITIVE (E.G., PROTECTING LIVES), OTHERS SEE THEM AS NEGATIVE (E.G., THE SIDE EFFECTS THAT ARE NOT FULLY UNDERSTOOD SCIENTIFICALLY), RESULTING IN DIVERSE SENTIMENTS TOWARDS VACCINATION CAMPAIGNS. IN ADDITION, THE DIVERSE SENTIMENTS HAVE SELDOM BEEN SYSTEMATICALLY QUANTIFIED LET ALONE THEIR DYNAMIC CHANGES OVER SPACE AND TIME. TO SHED LIGHT ON THIS ISSUE, WE PROPOSE AN APPROACH TO ANALYZE VACCINE SENTIMENTS IN SPACE AND TIME BY USING SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING COMBINED WITH WORD EMBEDDING TECHNIQUES. TAKING THE UNITED STATES AS A TEST CASE, WE UTILIZE A TWITTER DATASET (APPROXIMATELY 11.7 MILLION TWEETS) FROM JANUARY 2015 TO JULY 2021 AND MEASURE AND MAP VACCINE SENTIMENTS (PRO-VACCINE, ANTI-VACCINE, AND NEUTRAL) ACROSS THE NATION. IN DOING SO, WE CAN CAPTURE THE HETEROGENEOUS PUBLIC OPINIONS WITHIN SOCIAL MEDIA DISCUSSIONS REGARDING VACCINATION AMONG STATES. RESULTS SHOW HOW POSITIVE SENTIMENT IN SOCIAL MEDIA HAS A STRONG CORRELATION WITH THE ACTUAL VACCINATED POPULATION. FURTHERMORE, WE INTRODUCE A SIMPLE RATIO BETWEEN ANTI AND PRO-VACCINE AS A PROXY TO QUANTIFY VACCINE HESITANCY AND SHOW HOW OUR RESULTS ALIGN WITH OTHER TRADITIONAL SURVEY APPROACHES. THE PROPOSED APPROACH ILLUSTRATES THE POTENTIAL TO MONITOR THE DYNAMICS OF VACCINE OPINION DISTRIBUTION ONLINE, WHICH WE HOPE, CAN BE HELPFUL TO EXPLAIN VACCINATION RATES FOR THE ONGOING COVID-19 PANDEMIC.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
ANNOTATING REGULATORY ELEMENTS BY HETEROGENEOUS NETWORK EMBEDDING. MOTIVATION: REGULATORY ELEMENTS (RES), SUCH AS ENHANCERS AND PROMOTERS, ARE KNOWN AS REGULATORY SEQUENCES FUNCTIONAL IN A HETEROGENEOUS REGULATORY NETWORK TO CONTROL GENE EXPRESSION BY RECRUITING TRANSCRIPTION REGULATORS AND CARRYING GENETIC VARIANTS IN A CONTEXT SPECIFIC WAY. ANNOTATING THOSE RES RELIES ON COSTLY AND LABOR-INTENSIVE NEXT GENERATION SEQUENCING AND RNA-GUIDED EDITING TECHNOLOGIES IN MANY CELLULAR CONTEXTS. RESULTS: WE PROPOSE A SYSTEMATIC GENE ONTOLOGY ANNOTATION METHOD FOR REGULATORY ELEMENTS (RE-GOA) BY LEVERAGING THE POWERFUL WORD EMBEDDING IN NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING. WE FIRST ASSEMBLE A HETEROGENEOUS NETWORK BY INTEGRATING CONTEXT SPECIFIC REGULATIONS, PROTEIN-PROTEIN INTERACTIONS, AND GENE ONTOLOGY (GO) TERMS. THEN WE PERFORM NETWORK EMBEDDING AND ASSOCIATE REGULATORY ELEMENTS WITH GO TERMS BY ASSESSING THEIR SIMILARITY IN LOW DIMENSIONAL VECTOR SPACE. WITH THREE APPLICATIONS, WE SHOW THAT RE-GOA OUTPERFORMS EXISTING METHODS IN ANNOTATING TFS' BINDING SITES FROM CHIP-SEQ DATA, IN FUNCTIONAL ENRICHMENT ANALYSIS OF DIFFERENTIALLY ACCESSIBLE PEAKS FROM ATAC-SEQ DATA, AND IN REVEALING GENETIC CORRELATION AMONG PHENOTYPES FROM THEIR GWAS SUMMARY STATISTICS DATA. AVAILABILITY: THE SOURCE CODE AND THE SYSTEMATIC RE ANNOTATION FOR HUMAN AND MOUSE ARE AVAILABLE AT HTTPS://GITHUB.COM/AMSSWANGLAB/RE-GOA. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: SUPPLEMENTARY DATA ARE AVAILABLE AT BIOINFORMATICS ONLINE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
APPLICATION OF EDGE COMPUTING COMBINED WITH DEEP LEARNING MODEL IN THE DYNAMIC EVOLUTION OF NETWORK PUBLIC OPINION IN EMERGENCIES. THE AIM IS TO CLARIFY THE EVOLUTION MECHANISM OF NETWORK PUBLIC OPINION (NPO) IN PUBLIC EMERGENCIES. THIS WORK MAKES UP FOR THE INSUFFICIENT SEMANTIC UNDERSTANDING IN NPO-ORIENTED EMOTION ANALYSIS AND TRIES TO MAINTAIN SOCIAL HARMONY AND STABILITY. THE COMBINATION OF THE EDGE COMPUTING (EC) AND DEEP LEARNING (DL) MODEL IS APPLIED TO THE NPO-ORIENTED EMOTION RECOGNITION MODEL (ERM). FIRSTLY, THE NPO ON PUBLIC EMERGENCIES IS INTRODUCED. SECONDLY, THREE TYPES OF NPO EMERGENCIES ARE SELECTED AS RESEARCH CASES. AN EMOTIONAL RULE SYSTEM IS ESTABLISHED BASED ON THE ONE-CLASS CLASSIFICATION (OCC) MODEL AS EMOTIONAL STANDARDS. THE WORD EMBEDDING REPRESENTATION METHOD REPRESENTS THE PREPROCESSED WEIBO TEXT DATA. CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (CNN) IS USED AS THE CLASSIFIER. THE NPO-ORIENTED ERM IS IMPLEMENTED ON CNN AND VERIFIED THROUGH COMPARATIVE EXPERIMENTS AFTER THE CNN'S HYPERPARAMETERS ARE ADJUSTED. THE RESEARCH RESULTS SHOW THAT THE TEXT ANNOTATION OF THE NPO BASED ON OCC EMOTION RULES CAN OBTAIN BETTER RECOGNITION PERFORMANCE. ADDITIONALLY, THE RECOGNITION EFFECT OF THE IMPROVED CNN IS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THE SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE (SVM) IN TRADITIONAL MACHINE LEARNING (ML). THIS WORK REALIZES THE TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION OF AUTOMATIC EMOTION RECOGNITION OF NPO GROUPS AND PROVIDES A BASIS FOR THE RELEVANT GOVERNMENT AGENCIES TO HANDLE THE NPO IN PUBLIC EMERGENCIES SCIENTIFICALLY.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
APPLICATIONS OF NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING IN RADIOLOGY: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. BACKGROUND: RECENT ADVANCES IN PERFORMANCE OF NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) TECHNIQUES HAVE SPURRED WIDER USE AND MORE SOPHISTICATED APPLICATIONS OF NLP IN RADIOLOGY. THIS STUDY SYSTEMATICALLY REVIEWS THE TRENDS AND APPLICATIONS OF NLP IN RADIOLOGY WITHIN THE LAST FIVE YEARS. METHODS: A SEARCH OF THREE DATABASES OF PEER-REVIEWED JOURNAL ARTICLES AND CONFERENCE PAPERS FROM JANUARY 1, 2016 TO APRIL 21, 2021 RESULTED IN A TOTAL OF 228 PUBLICATIONS INCLUDED IN THE REVIEW. MANUSCRIPTS WERE ANALYZED BY SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING CLINICAL APPLICATION, STUDY SETTING, NLP TECHNIQUE, AND PERFORMANCE. RESULTS: OF THE 228 INCLUDED PUBLICATIONS, THERE WAS AN OVERALL INCREASE IN NUMBER OF STUDIES PUBLISHED WITH AN INCREASE IN USE OF MACHINE LEARNING MODELS. NLP MODELS SHOWED HIGH PERFORMANCE: >50% OF PUBLICATIONS REPORTED F1 > 0.91. THERE WAS VARIABLE SAMPLE SIZE ACROSS THE STUDIES WITH A MEDIAN OF 3708 DATA POINTS, MOST COMMONLY RADIOLOGY REPORTS. 145 STUDIES UTILIZED DATA FROM A SINGLE ACADEMIC CENTER. APPLICATIONS WERE CLASSIFIED AS CLINICAL (N = 87), TECHNICAL (N = 66), QUALITY IMPROVEMENT (N = 61), RESEARCH (N = 9), AND EDUCATION (N = 5). DISCUSSION: THERE HAS BEEN A CONTINUED INCREASE IN NUMBER OF STUDIES INVOLVING NLP IN RADIOLOGY. NEWER NLP TECHNIQUES, INCLUDING WORD EMBEDDING, DEEP LEARNING, AND TRANSFORMERS, ARE BEING APPLIED AND SHOW IMPROVED PERFORMANCE. THERE HAS BEEN GROWTH IN THE INTERPRETATIVE AND NON-INTERPRETATIVE USE OF NLP TECHNIQUES IN RADIOLOGY AND HAS GREAT CAPACITY TO IMPROVE PATIENT CARE AND DELIVERY. ALTHOUGH THE PERFORMANCE AND BREADTH OF NLP APPLICATIONS IS IMPRESSIVE, THERE IS AN OVERALL LACK OF HIGH-LEVEL EVIDENCE FOR ACTUAL CLINICAL APPLICATION OF PUBLISHED TOOLS. CONCLUSION: NLP APPLICATIONS IN RADIOLOGY HAS BEEN INCREASING STUDIED AND MORE ACCURATE IN THE LAST 5 YEARS. MORE DIRECT CLINICAL APPLICATION AND PORTABILITY OF THE NLP PIPELINES IS NEED TO REACH THE TECHNOLOGY'S FULL POTENTIAL.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
APPLYING CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS TO PREDICT THE ICD-9 CODES OF MEDICAL RECORDS. THE INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASE AND RELATED HEALTH PROBLEMS (ICD) IS AN INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SYSTEM FOR CATEGORIZING AND REPORTING DISEASES, INJURIES, DISORDERS, AND HEALTH CONDITIONS. MOST PREVIOUSLY-PROPOSED DISEASE PREDICTING SYSTEMS NEED CLINICAL INFORMATION COLLECTED BY THE MEDICAL STAFF FROM THE PATIENTS IN HOSPITALS. IN THIS PAPER, WE PROPOSE A DEEP LEARNING ALGORITHM TO CLASSIFY DISEASE TYPES AND IDENTIFY DIAGNOSTIC CODES BY USING ONLY THE SUBJECTIVE COMPONENT OF PROGRESS NOTES IN MEDICAL RECORDS. IN THIS STUDY, WE HAVE A DATASET, CONSISTING OF ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY-EIGHT THOUSAND MEDICAL RECORDS, FROM A MEDICAL CENTER, COLLECTED DURING 2003 AND 2017. FIRST, WE APPLY STANDARD TEXT PROCESSING PROCEDURES TO PARSE THE SENTENCES AND WORD EMBEDDING TECHNIQUES FOR VECTOR REPRESENTATIONS. NEXT, WE BUILD A CONVOLUTION NEURAL NETWORK MODEL ON THE MEDICAL RECORDS TO PREDICT THE ICD-9 CODE BY USING A SUBJECTIVE COMPONENT OF THE PROGRESS NOTE. THE PREDICTION PERFORMANCE IS EVALUATED BY TEN-FOLD CROSS-VALIDATION AND YIELDS AN ACCURACY OF 0.409, RECALL OF 0.409 AND PRECISION OF 0.436. IF WE ONLY CONSIDER THE "CHAPTER MATCH" OF ICD-9 CODE, OUR MODEL ACHIEVES AN ACCURACY OF 0.580, RECALL OF 0.580, AND PRECISION OF 0.582. SINCE OUR DIAGNOSTIC CODE PREDICTION MODEL IS SOLELY BASED ON SUBJECTIVE COMPONENTS (MAINLY, PATIENTS' SELF-REPORT DESCRIPTIONS), THE PROPOSED APPROACH COULD SERVE AS A REMOTE AND SELF-DIAGNOSIS ASSISTANCE TOOL, PRIOR TO SEEKING MEDICAL ADVICE OR GOING TO THE HOSPITAL. IN ADDITION, OUR WORK MAY BE USED AS A PRIMARY EVALUATION TOOL FOR DISCOMFORT IN THE RURAL AREA WHERE MEDICAL RESOURCES ARE RESTRICTED.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
APPLYING INTERNET INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY COMBINED WITH DEEP LEARNING TO TOURISM COLLABORATIVE RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM. RECENTLY, MORE PERSONALIZED TRAVEL METHODS HAVE EMERGED IN THE TOURISM INDUSTRY, SUCH AS INDIVIDUAL TRAVEL AND SELF-GUIDED TRAVEL. THE SERVICE MODELS OF TRADITIONAL TOURISM LIMIT THE DIVERSITY OF SERVICE OPTIONS AND CANNOT FULLY MEET THE INDIVIDUAL NEEDS OF TOURISTS ANYMORE. THE AIM IS TO INTEGRATE SPARSE TOURISM INFORMATION ON THE INTERNET, THEREBY PROVIDING MORE CONVENIENT, FASTER, AND MORE PERSONALIZED TOURISM SERVICES. BASED ON THE SHORTCOMINGS OF THE TRADITIONAL TOURISM RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM, A DEEP LEARNING-BASED CLASSIFICATION PROCESSING METHOD OF TOURISM PRODUCT INFORMATION IS PROPOSED. THIS METHOD USES WORD EMBEDDING IN THE DATA PREPROCESSING STAGE. THE CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (CNN) IS USED TO PROCESS REVIEW INFORMATION OF USERS AND TOURISM SERVICE ITEMS. THE DEEP NEURAL NETWORK (DNN) IS USED TO PROCESS THE NECESSARY INFORMATION OF USERS AND TOURISM SERVICE ITEMS. ALSO, FACTORIZATION MACHINE TECHNOLOGY IS USED TO LEARN THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE EXTRACTED FEATURES TO IMPROVE THE PREDICTION MODEL. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE PROPOSED MODEL CAN MAINTAIN AN EXCELLENT PRECISION OF 64.2% WHEN GENERATING PERSONALIZED RECOMMENDATION LISTS FOR USERS. THE SENSITIVITY AND ACCURACY OF THE RECOMMENDATION LIST ARE BETTER THAN OTHER ALGORITHMS. BY ADDING DNN, THE WORD EMBEDDING METHOD, AND THE FACTORIZATION MACHINE MODEL, THE PRECISION IS IMPROVED BY 30%, 33.3%, AND 40%, RESPECTIVELY. THE MODEL ACCURACY IS THE HIGHEST WITH 40 HIDDEN FACTORS, 100 CONVOLUTIONS, AND A 100+50 COMBINATION HIDDEN LAYER. COMPARED WITH TRADITIONAL METHODS, THE PROPOSED ALGORITHM CAN PROVIDE USERS WITH PERSONALIZED TRAVEL PRODUCTS MORE ACCURATELY IN PERSONALIZED TRAVEL RECOMMENDATIONS. THE RESULTS HAVE ENRICHED AND DEVELOPED THE THEORY OF TOURISM SERVICE SUPPLY CHAIN, PROVIDING A REFERENCE FOR CONSTRUCTING A PERSONALIZED TOURISM SERVICE SYSTEM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE LEARNING SEMANTICS VIA EXTERNAL RESOURCES FOR CLASSIFYING DIAGNOSIS CODES IN DISCHARGE NOTES. BACKGROUND: AUTOMATED DISEASE CODE CLASSIFICATION USING FREE-TEXT MEDICAL INFORMATION IS IMPORTANT FOR PUBLIC HEALTH SURVEILLANCE. HOWEVER, TRADITIONAL NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) PIPELINES ARE LIMITED, SO WE PROPOSE A METHOD COMBINING WORD EMBEDDING WITH A CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (CNN). OBJECTIVE: OUR OBJECTIVE WAS TO COMPARE THE PERFORMANCE OF TRADITIONAL PIPELINES (NLP PLUS SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING MODELS) WITH THAT OF WORD EMBEDDING COMBINED WITH A CNN IN CONDUCTING A CLASSIFICATION TASK IDENTIFYING INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASES, TENTH REVISION, CLINICAL MODIFICATION (ICD-10-CM) DIAGNOSIS CODES IN DISCHARGE NOTES. METHODS: WE USED 2 CLASSIFICATION METHODS: (1) EXTRACTING FROM DISCHARGE NOTES SOME FEATURES (TERMS, N-GRAM PHRASES, AND SNOMED CT CATEGORIES) THAT WE USED TO TRAIN A SET OF SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING MODELS (SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE, RANDOM FORESTS, AND GRADIENT BOOSTING MACHINE), AND (2) BUILDING A FEATURE MATRIX, BY A PRETRAINED WORD EMBEDDING MODEL, THAT WE USED TO TRAIN A CNN. WE USED THESE METHODS TO IDENTIFY THE CHAPTER-LEVEL ICD-10-CM DIAGNOSIS CODES IN A SET OF DISCHARGE NOTES. WE CONDUCTED THE EVALUATION USING 103,390 DISCHARGE NOTES COVERING PATIENTS HOSPITALIZED FROM JUNE 1, 2015 TO JANUARY 31, 2017 IN THE TRI-SERVICE GENERAL HOSPITAL IN TAIPEI, TAIWAN. WE USED THE RECEIVER OPERATING CHARACTERISTIC CURVE AS AN EVALUATION MEASURE, AND CALCULATED THE AREA UNDER THE CURVE (AUC) AND F-MEASURE AS THE GLOBAL MEASURE OF EFFECTIVENESS. RESULTS: IN 5-FOLD CROSS-VALIDATION TESTS, OUR METHOD HAD A HIGHER TESTING ACCURACY (MEAN AUC 0.9696; MEAN F-MEASURE 0.9086) THAN TRADITIONAL NLP-BASED APPROACHES (MEAN AUC RANGE 0.8183-0.9571; MEAN F-MEASURE RANGE 0.5050-0.8739). A REAL-WORLD SIMULATION THAT SPLIT THE TRAINING SAMPLE AND THE TESTING SAMPLE BY DATE VERIFIED THIS RESULT (MEAN AUC 0.9645; MEAN F-MEASURE 0.9003 USING THE PROPOSED METHOD). FURTHER ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT THE CONVOLUTIONAL LAYERS OF THE CNN EFFECTIVELY IDENTIFIED A LARGE NUMBER OF KEYWORDS AND AUTOMATICALLY EXTRACTED ENOUGH CONCEPTS TO PREDICT THE DIAGNOSIS CODES. CONCLUSIONS: WORD EMBEDDING COMBINED WITH A CNN SHOWED OUTSTANDING PERFORMANCE COMPARED WITH TRADITIONAL METHODS, NEEDING VERY LITTLE DATA PREPROCESSING. THIS SHOWS THAT FUTURE STUDIES WILL NOT BE LIMITED BY INCOMPLETE DICTIONARIES. A LARGE AMOUNT OF UNSTRUCTURED INFORMATION FROM FREE-TEXT MEDICAL WRITING WILL BE EXTRACTED BY AUTOMATED APPROACHES IN THE FUTURE, AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE HEALTH CARE FIELD IS ABOUT TO ENTER THE AGE OF BIG DATA.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE-BASED MULTIMODAL RISK ASSESSMENT MODEL FOR SURGICAL SITE INFECTION (AMRAMS): DEVELOPMENT AND VALIDATION STUDY. BACKGROUND: SURGICAL SITE INFECTION (SSI) IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON TYPES OF HEALTH CARE-ASSOCIATED INFECTIONS. IT INCREASES MORTALITY, PROLONGS HOSPITAL LENGTH OF STAY, AND RAISES HEALTH CARE COSTS. MANY INSTITUTIONS DEVELOPED RISK ASSESSMENT MODELS FOR SSI TO HELP SURGEONS PREOPERATIVELY IDENTIFY HIGH-RISK PATIENTS AND GUIDE CLINICAL INTERVENTION. HOWEVER, MOST OF THESE MODELS HAD LOW ACCURACIES. OBJECTIVE: WE AIMED TO PROVIDE A SOLUTION IN THE FORM OF AN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE-BASED MULTIMODAL RISK ASSESSMENT MODEL FOR SURGICAL SITE INFECTION (AMRAMS) FOR INPATIENTS UNDERGOING OPERATIONS, USING ROUTINELY COLLECTED CLINICAL DATA. WE INTERNALLY AND EXTERNALLY VALIDATED THE DISCRIMINATIONS OF THE MODELS, WHICH COMBINED VARIOUS MACHINE LEARNING AND NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING TECHNIQUES, AND COMPARED THEM WITH THE NATIONAL NOSOCOMIAL INFECTIONS SURVEILLANCE (NNIS) RISK INDEX. METHODS: WE RETRIEVED INPATIENT RECORDS BETWEEN JANUARY 1, 2014, AND JUNE 30, 2019, FROM THE ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORD (EMR) SYSTEM OF RUI JIN HOSPITAL, LUWAN BRANCH, SHANGHAI, CHINA. WE USED DATA FROM BEFORE JULY 1, 2018, AS THE DEVELOPMENT SET FOR INTERNAL VALIDATION AND THE REMAINING DATA AS THE TEST SET FOR EXTERNAL VALIDATION. WE INCLUDED PATIENT DEMOGRAPHICS, PREOPERATIVE LAB RESULTS, AND FREE-TEXT PREOPERATIVE NOTES AS OUR FEATURES. WE USED WORD-EMBEDDING TECHNIQUES TO ENCODE TEXT INFORMATION, AND WE TRAINED THE LASSO (LEAST ABSOLUTE SHRINKAGE AND SELECTION OPERATOR) MODEL, RANDOM FOREST MODEL, GRADIENT BOOSTING DECISION TREE (GBDT) MODEL, CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (CNN) MODEL, AND SELF-ATTENTION NETWORK MODEL USING THE COMBINED DATA. SURGEONS MANUALLY SCORED THE NNIS RISK INDEX VALUES. RESULTS: FOR INTERNAL BOOTSTRAPPING VALIDATION, CNN YIELDED THE HIGHEST MEAN AREA UNDER THE RECEIVER OPERATING CHARACTERISTIC CURVE (AUROC) OF 0.889 (95% CI 0.886-0.892), AND THE PAIRED-SAMPLE T TEST REVEALED STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGES AS COMPARED WITH OTHER MODELS (P<.001). THE SELF-ATTENTION NETWORK YIELDED THE SECOND-HIGHEST MEAN AUROC OF 0.882 (95% CI 0.878-0.886), BUT THE AUROC WAS ONLY NUMERICALLY HIGHER THAN THE AUROC OF THE THIRD-BEST MODEL, GBDT WITH TEXT EMBEDDINGS (MEAN AUROC 0.881, 95% CI 0.878-0.884, P=.47). THE AUROCS OF LASSO, RANDOM FOREST, AND GBDT MODELS USING TEXT EMBEDDINGS WERE STATISTICALLY HIGHER THAN THE AUROCS OF MODELS NOT USING TEXT EMBEDDINGS (P<.001). FOR EXTERNAL VALIDATION, THE SELF-ATTENTION NETWORK YIELDED THE HIGHEST AUROC OF 0.879. CNN WAS THE SECOND-BEST MODEL (AUROC 0.878), AND GBDT WITH TEXT EMBEDDINGS WAS THE THIRD-BEST MODEL (AUROC 0.872). THE NNIS RISK INDEX SCORED BY SURGEONS HAD AN AUROC OF 0.651. CONCLUSIONS: OUR AMRAMS BASED ON EMR DATA AND DEEP LEARNING METHODS-CNN AND SELF-ATTENTION NETWORK-HAD SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGES IN TERMS OF ACCURACY COMPARED WITH OTHER CONVENTIONAL MACHINE LEARNING METHODS AND THE NNIS RISK INDEX. MOREOVER, THE SEMANTIC EMBEDDINGS OF PREOPERATIVE NOTES IMPROVED THE MODEL PERFORMANCE FURTHER. OUR MODELS COULD REPLACE THE NNIS RISK INDEX TO PROVIDE PERSONALIZED GUIDANCE FOR THE PREOPERATIVE INTERVENTION OF SSIS. THROUGH THIS CASE, WE OFFERED AN EASY-TO-IMPLEMENT SOLUTION FOR BUILDING MULTIMODAL RAMS FOR OTHER SIMILAR SCENARIOS.                                                                                                                                                                               
ASPECT EXTRACTION ON USER TEXTUAL REVIEWS USING MULTI-CHANNEL CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK. ASPECT EXTRACTION IS A SUBTASK OF SENTIMENT ANALYSIS THAT DEALS WITH IDENTIFYING OPINION TARGETS IN AN OPINIONATED TEXT. EXISTING APPROACHES TO ASPECT EXTRACTION TYPICALLY RELY ON USING HANDCRAFTED FEATURES, LINEAR AND INTEGRATED NETWORK ARCHITECTURES. ALTHOUGH THESE METHODS CAN ACHIEVE GOOD PERFORMANCES, THEY ARE TIME-CONSUMING AND OFTEN VERY COMPLICATED. IN REAL-LIFE SYSTEMS, A SIMPLE MODEL WITH COMPETITIVE RESULTS IS GENERALLY MORE EFFECTIVE AND PREFERABLE OVER COMPLICATED MODELS. IN THIS PAPER, WE PRESENT A MULTICHANNEL CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK FOR ASPECT EXTRACTION. THE MODEL CONSISTS OF A DEEP CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK WITH TWO INPUT CHANNELS: A WORD EMBEDDING CHANNEL WHICH AIMS TO ENCODE SEMANTIC INFORMATION OF THE WORDS AND A PART OF SPEECH (POS) TAG EMBEDDING CHANNEL TO FACILITATE THE SEQUENTIAL TAGGING PROCESS. TO GET THE VECTOR REPRESENTATION OF WORDS, WE INITIALIZED THE WORD EMBEDDING CHANNEL AND THE POS CHANNEL USING PRETRAINED WORD2VEC AND ONE-HOT-VECTOR OF POS TAGS, RESPECTIVELY. BOTH THE WORD EMBEDDING AND THE POS EMBEDDING VECTORS WERE FED INTO THE CONVOLUTIONAL LAYER AND CONCATENATED TO A ONE-DIMENSIONAL VECTOR, WHICH IS FINALLY POOLED AND PROCESSED USING A SOFTMAX FUNCTION FOR SEQUENCE LABELING. WE FINALLY CONDUCTED A SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS USING FOUR DIFFERENT DATASETS. THE RESULTS INDICATED BETTER PERFORMANCE COMPARED TO THE BASELINE MODELS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
ASSESSING THE SEVERITY OF POSITIVE VALENCE SYMPTOMS IN INITIAL PSYCHIATRIC EVALUATION RECORDS: SHOULD WE USE CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS? BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: EFFICIENTLY CAPTURING THE SEVERITY OF POSITIVE VALENCE SYMPTOMS COULD AID IN RISK STRATIFICATION FOR ADVERSE OUTCOMES AMONG PATIENTS WITH PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS AND IDENTIFY OPTIMAL TREATMENT STRATEGIES FOR PATIENT SUBGROUPS. MOTIVATED BY THE SUCCESS OF CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS (CNNS) IN CLASSIFICATION TASKS, WE STUDIED THE APPLICATION OF VARIOUS CNN ARCHITECTURES AND THEIR PERFORMANCE IN PREDICTING THE SEVERITY OF POSITIVE VALENCE SYMPTOMS IN PATIENTS WITH PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS BASED ON INITIAL PSYCHIATRIC EVALUATION RECORDS. METHODS: PSYCHIATRIC EVALUATION RECORDS CONTAIN UNSTRUCTURED TEXT AND SEMI-STRUCTURED DATA SUCH AS QUESTION-ANSWER PAIRS. FOR A GIVEN RECORD, WE TOKENISE AND NORMALISE THE SEMI-STRUCTURED CONTENT. PRE-PROCESSED TOKENISED WORDS ARE REPRESENTED AS ONE-HOT ENCODED WORD VECTORS. WE THEN APPLY DIFFERENT CONFIGURATIONS OF CONVOLUTIONAL AND MAX POOLING LAYERS TO AUTOMATICALLY LEARN IMPORTANT FEATURES FROM VARIOUS WORD REPRESENTATIONS. WE CONDUCTED A SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS TO EXPLORE THE EFFECT OF DIFFERENT CNN ARCHITECTURES ON THE CLASSIFICATION OF PSYCHIATRIC RECORDS. RESULTS: OUR BEST CNN MODEL ACHIEVED A MEAN ABSOLUTE ERROR (MAE) OF 0.539 AND A NORMALIZED MAE OF 0.785 ON THE TEST DATASET, WHICH IS COMPARABLE TO THE OTHER WELL-KNOWN TEXT CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHMS STUDIED IN THIS WORK. OUR RESULTS ALSO SUGGEST THAT THE NORMALISATION STEP HAS A GREAT IMPACT ON THE PERFORMANCE OF THE DEVELOPED MODELS. CONCLUSIONS: WE DEMONSTRATE THAT NORMALISATION OF THE SEMI-STRUCTURED CONTENTS CAN IMPROVE THE MAE AMONG ALL CNN CONFIGURATIONS. WITHOUT ADVANCED FEATURE ENGINEERING, CNN-BASED APPROACHES CAN PROVIDE A COMPARABLE SOLUTION FOR CLASSIFYING POSITIVE VALENCE SYMPTOM SEVERITY IN INITIAL PSYCHIATRIC EVALUATION RECORDS. ALTHOUGH WORD EMBEDDING IS WELL KNOWN FOR ITS ABILITY TO CAPTURE RELATIVELY LOW-DIMENSIONAL SIMILARITY BETWEEN WORDS, OUR EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS SHOW THAT PRE-TRAINED EMBEDDINGS DO NOT IMPROVE THE CLASSIFICATION PERFORMANCE. THIS PHENOMENON MAY BE DUE TO THE INABILITY OF WORD EMBEDDINGS TO CAPTURE PROBLEM SPECIFIC CONTEXTUAL SEMANTIC INFORMATION IMPLYING THE QUALITY OF THE EMPLOYING EMBEDDING IS CRITICAL FOR OBTAINING AN ACCURATE CNN MODEL.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
ATTITUDES TOWARD MULTILINGUALISM IN LUXEMBOURG. A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF ONLINE NEWS COMMENTS AND CROWDSOURCED QUESTIONNAIRE DATA. ATTITUDES ARE A FUNDAMENTAL CHARACTERISTIC OF HUMAN ACTIVITY. THEIR MAIN FUNCTION IS THE SITUATIONAL ASSESSMENT OF PHENOMENA IN PRACTICE TO MAINTAIN ACTION ABILITY AND TO PROVIDE ORIENTATION IN SOCIAL INTERACTION. IN SOCIOLINGUISTICS, RESEARCH INTO ATTITUDES TOWARD VARIETIES AND THEIR SPEAKERS IS A CENTRAL COMPONENT OF THE ANALYSIS OF LINGUISTIC AND CULTURAL DYNAMICS. IN RECENT YEARS, COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS HAS ALSO SHOWN AN INCREASED INTEREST IN THE SOCIAL CONDITIONALITY OF LANGUAGE. TO DATE, SUCH APPROACHES HAVE LACKED A LINGUISTICALLY BASED THEORY OF ATTITUDES, WHICH, FOR EXAMPLE, ENABLES AN EXACT TERMINOLOGICAL DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN PUBLICLY TAKEN STANCES AND THE ASSUMED UNDERLYING ATTITUDES. AGAINST THIS BACKDROP, THE PRESENT STUDY CONTRIBUTES TO THE CONNECTION OF SOCIOLINGUISTIC AND COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTIC APPROACHES TO THE ANALYSIS OF LANGUAGE ATTITUDES. WE MODEL A FREE TEXT CORPUS OF USER COMMENTS FROM THE RTL.LU NEWS PLATFORM USING REPRESENTATION LEARNING (WORD2VEC). IN THE AGGREGATED DATA, WE LOOK FOR CONTEXTUAL SIMILARITIES BETWEEN VECTOR REPRESENTATIONS OF WORDS THAT PROVIDE EVIDENCE OF STANCES TOWARD MULTILINGUALISM IN LUXEMBOURG. WE THEN CONTRAST THIS DATA WITH THE RESULTS OF A QUANTITATIVE ATTITUDES STUDY, WHICH WAS CARRIED OUT AS PART OF THE CROWDSOURCING PROJECT "SCHNESSEN." THE COMBINATION OF THE DIFFERENT DATASETS ENABLES THE RECONSTRUCTION OF SOCIALLY PERTINENT ATTITUDES REPRESENTED IN PUBLIC DISCOURSE. THE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THE CENTRAL IMPORTANCE OF ATTITUDES TOWARD THE DIFFERENT LANGUAGES IN LUXEMBOURG FOR THE CULTURAL SELF-UNDERSTANDING OF THE POPULATION. WE ALSO INTRODUCE A TOOL FOR THE AUTOMATIC ORTHOGRAPHIC CORRECTION OF LUXEMBOURGISH TEXTS (SPELLUX). IN VIEW OF THE ONGOING STANDARDIZATION OF LUXEMBOURGISH AND A LACK OF RULE KNOWLEDGE IN THE POPULATION, ORTHOGRAPHIC VARIATION-AMONG OTHER FACTORS LIKE CODE-SWITCHING OR REGIONAL DIALECTS-POSES A GREAT CHALLENGE FOR THE AUTOMATIC PROCESSING OF TEXT DATA. THE CORRECTION TOOL ENABLES THE ORTHOGRAPHIC NORMALIZATION OF LUXEMBOURGISH TEXTS AND WITH THAT A CONSOLIDATION OF THE VOCABULARY FOR THE TRAINING OF WORD EMBEDDING MODELS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
AUGMENTING SEMANTIC LEXICONS USING WORD EMBEDDINGS AND TRANSFER LEARNING. SENTIMENT-AWARE INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS ARE ESSENTIAL TO A WIDE ARRAY OF APPLICATIONS. THESE SYSTEMS ARE DRIVEN BY LANGUAGE MODELS WHICH BROADLY FALL INTO TWO PARADIGMS: LEXICON-BASED AND CONTEXTUAL. ALTHOUGH RECENT CONTEXTUAL MODELS ARE INCREASINGLY DOMINANT, WE STILL SEE DEMAND FOR LEXICON-BASED MODELS BECAUSE OF THEIR INTERPRETABILITY AND EASE OF USE. FOR EXAMPLE, LEXICON-BASED MODELS ALLOW RESEARCHERS TO READILY DETERMINE WHICH WORDS AND PHRASES CONTRIBUTE MOST TO A CHANGE IN MEASURED SENTIMENT. A CHALLENGE FOR ANY LEXICON-BASED APPROACH IS THAT THE LEXICON NEEDS TO BE ROUTINELY EXPANDED WITH NEW WORDS AND EXPRESSIONS. HERE, WE PROPOSE TWO MODELS FOR AUTOMATIC LEXICON EXPANSION. OUR FIRST MODEL ESTABLISHES A BASELINE EMPLOYING A SIMPLE AND SHALLOW NEURAL NETWORK INITIALIZED WITH PRE-TRAINED WORD EMBEDDINGS USING A NON-CONTEXTUAL APPROACH. OUR SECOND MODEL IMPROVES UPON OUR BASELINE, FEATURING A DEEP TRANSFORMER-BASED NETWORK THAT BRINGS TO BEAR WORD DEFINITIONS TO ESTIMATE THEIR LEXICAL POLARITY. OUR EVALUATION SHOWS THAT BOTH MODELS ARE ABLE TO SCORE NEW WORDS WITH A SIMILAR ACCURACY TO REVIEWERS FROM AMAZON MECHANICAL TURK, BUT AT A FRACTION OF THE COST.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
AUTOMATED CLASSIFICATION OF CLINICAL TRIAL ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA TEXT BASED ON ENSEMBLE LEARNING AND METRIC LEARNING. BACKGROUND: ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA ARE THE PRIMARY STRATEGY FOR SCREENING THE TARGET PARTICIPANTS OF A CLINICAL TRIAL. AUTOMATED CLASSIFICATION OF CLINICAL TRIAL ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA TEXT BY USING MACHINE LEARNING METHODS IMPROVES RECRUITMENT EFFICIENCY TO REDUCE THE COST OF CLINICAL RESEARCH. HOWEVER, EXISTING METHODS SUFFER FROM POOR CLASSIFICATION PERFORMANCE DUE TO THE COMPLEXITY AND IMBALANCE OF ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA TEXT DATA. METHODS: AN ENSEMBLE LEARNING-BASED MODEL WITH METRIC LEARNING IS PROPOSED FOR ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA CLASSIFICATION. THE MODEL INTEGRATES A SET OF PRE-TRAINED MODELS INCLUDING BIDIRECTIONAL ENCODER REPRESENTATIONS FROM TRANSFORMERS (BERT), A ROBUSTLY OPTIMIZED BERT PRETRAINING APPROACH (ROBERTA), XLNET, PRE-TRAINING TEXT ENCODERS AS DISCRIMINATORS RATHER THAN GENERATORS (ELECTRA), AND ENHANCED REPRESENTATION THROUGH KNOWLEDGE INTEGRATION (ERNIE). FOCAL LOSS IS USED AS A LOSS FUNCTION TO ADDRESS THE DATA IMBALANCE PROBLEM. METRIC LEARNING IS EMPLOYED TO TRAIN THE EMBEDDING OF EACH BASE MODEL FOR FEATURE DISTINGUISH. SOFT VOTING IS APPLIED TO ACHIEVE FINAL CLASSIFICATION OF THE ENSEMBLE MODEL. THE DATASET IS FROM THE STANDARD EVALUATION TASK 3 OF 5TH CHINA HEALTH INFORMATION PROCESSING CONFERENCE CONTAINING 38,341 ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA TEXT IN 44 CATEGORIES. RESULTS: OUR ENSEMBLE METHOD HAD AN ACCURACY OF 0.8497, A PRECISION OF 0.8229, AND A RECALL OF 0.8216 ON THE DATASET. THE MACRO F1-SCORE WAS 0.8169, OUTPERFORMING STATE-OF-THE-ART BASELINE METHODS BY 0.84% IMPROVEMENT ON AVERAGE. IN ADDITION, THE PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT HAD A P-VALUE OF 2.152E-07 WITH A STANDARD T-TEST, INDICATING THAT OUR MODEL ACHIEVED A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT. CONCLUSIONS: A MODEL FOR CLASSIFYING ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA TEXT OF CLINICAL TRIALS BASED ON MULTI-MODEL ENSEMBLE LEARNING AND METRIC LEARNING WAS PROPOSED. THE EXPERIMENTS DEMONSTRATED THAT THE CLASSIFICATION PERFORMANCE WAS IMPROVED BY OUR ENSEMBLE MODEL SIGNIFICANTLY. IN ADDITION, METRIC LEARNING WAS ABLE TO IMPROVE WORD EMBEDDING REPRESENTATION AND THE FOCAL LOSS REDUCED THE IMPACT OF DATA IMBALANCE TO MODEL PERFORMANCE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
AUTOMATED CODING OF UNDER-STUDIED MEDICAL CONCEPT DOMAINS: LINKING PHYSICAL ACTIVITY REPORTS TO THE INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF FUNCTIONING, DISABILITY, AND HEALTH. LINKING CLINICAL NARRATIVES TO STANDARDIZED VOCABULARIES AND CODING SYSTEMS IS A KEY COMPONENT OF UNLOCKING THE INFORMATION IN MEDICAL TEXT FOR ANALYSIS. HOWEVER, MANY DOMAINS OF MEDICAL CONCEPTS, SUCH AS FUNCTIONAL OUTCOMES AND SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH, LACK WELL-DEVELOPED TERMINOLOGIES THAT CAN SUPPORT EFFECTIVE CODING OF MEDICAL TEXT. WE PRESENT A FRAMEWORK FOR DEVELOPING NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) TECHNOLOGIES FOR AUTOMATED CODING OF MEDICAL INFORMATION IN UNDER-STUDIED DOMAINS, AND DEMONSTRATE ITS APPLICABILITY THROUGH A CASE STUDY ON PHYSICAL MOBILITY FUNCTION. MOBILITY FUNCTION IS A COMPONENT OF MANY HEALTH MEASURES, FROM POST-ACUTE CARE AND SURGICAL OUTCOMES TO CHRONIC FRAILTY AND DISABILITY, AND IS REPRESENTED AS ONE DOMAIN OF HUMAN ACTIVITY IN THE INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF FUNCTIONING, DISABILITY, AND HEALTH (ICF). HOWEVER, MOBILITY AND OTHER TYPES OF FUNCTIONAL ACTIVITY REMAIN UNDER-STUDIED IN THE MEDICAL INFORMATICS LITERATURE, AND NEITHER THE ICF NOR COMMONLY-USED MEDICAL TERMINOLOGIES CAPTURE FUNCTIONAL STATUS TERMINOLOGY IN PRACTICE. WE INVESTIGATED TWO DATA-DRIVEN PARADIGMS, CLASSIFICATION AND CANDIDATE SELECTION, TO LINK NARRATIVE OBSERVATIONS OF MOBILITY STATUS TO STANDARDIZED ICF CODES, USING A DATASET OF CLINICAL NARRATIVES FROM PHYSICAL THERAPY ENCOUNTERS. RECENT ADVANCES IN LANGUAGE MODELING AND WORD EMBEDDING WERE USED AS FEATURES FOR ESTABLISHED MACHINE LEARNING MODELS AND A NOVEL DEEP LEARNING APPROACH, ACHIEVING A MACRO-AVERAGED F-1 SCORE OF 84% ON LINKING MOBILITY ACTIVITY REPORTS TO ICF CODES. BOTH CLASSIFICATION AND CANDIDATE SELECTION APPROACHES PRESENT DISTINCT STRENGTHS FOR AUTOMATED CODING IN UNDER-STUDIED DOMAINS, AND WE HIGHLIGHT THAT THE COMBINATION OF (I) A SMALL ANNOTATED DATA SET; (II) EXPERT DEFINITIONS OF CODES OF INTEREST; AND (III) A REPRESENTATIVE TEXT CORPUS IS SUFFICIENT TO PRODUCE HIGH-PERFORMING AUTOMATED CODING SYSTEMS. THIS RESEARCH HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR CONTINUED DEVELOPMENT OF LANGUAGE TECHNOLOGIES TO ANALYZE FUNCTIONAL STATUS INFORMATION, AND THE ONGOING GROWTH OF NLP TOOLS FOR A VARIETY OF SPECIALIZED APPLICATIONS IN CLINICAL CARE AND RESEARCH.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
AUTOMATED DETECTION OF ALTERED MENTAL STATUS IN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT CLINICAL NOTES: A DEEP LEARNING APPROACH. BACKGROUND: MACHINE LEARNING HAS BEEN USED EXTENSIVELY IN CLINICAL TEXT CLASSIFICATION TASKS. DEEP LEARNING APPROACHES USING WORD EMBEDDINGS HAVE BEEN RECENTLY GAINING MOMENTUM IN BIOMEDICAL APPLICATIONS. IN AN EFFORT TO AUTOMATE THE IDENTIFICATION OF ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (AMS) IN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT PROVIDER NOTES FOR THE PURPOSE OF DECISION SUPPORT, WE COMPARE THE PERFORMANCE OF CLASSIC BAG-OF-WORDS-BASED MACHINE LEARNING CLASSIFIERS AND NOVEL DEEP LEARNING APPROACHES. METHODS: WE USED A CASE-CONTROL STUDY DESIGN TO EXTRACT AN ADEQUATE NUMBER OF CLINICAL NOTES WITH AMS AND NON-AMS BASED ON ICD CODES. THE NOTES WERE PARSED TO EXTRACT THE HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS, WHICH WAS USED AS THE CLINICAL TEXT FOR THE CLASSIFIERS. THE NOTES WERE MANUALLY LABELED BY CLINICIANS. AS A BASELINE FOR COMPARISON, WE TESTED SEVERAL TRADITIONAL BAG-OF-WORDS BASED CLASSIFIERS. WE THEN TESTED SEVERAL DEEP LEARNING MODELS USING A CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK ARCHITECTURE WITH THREE DIFFERENT TYPES OF WORD EMBEDDINGS, A PRE-TRAINED WORD2VEC MODEL AND TWO MODELS WITHOUT PRE-TRAINING BUT WITH DIFFERENT WORD EMBEDDING DIMENSIONS. RESULTS: WE EVALUATED THE MODELS ON 1130 LABELED NOTES FROM THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT. THE DEEP LEARNING MODELS HAD THE BEST OVERALL PERFORMANCE WITH AN AREA UNDER THE ROC CURVE OF 98.5% AND AN ACCURACY OF 94.5%. PRE-TRAINING WORD EMBEDDINGS ON THE UNLABELED CORPUS REDUCED TRAINING ITERATIONS AND HAD PERFORMANCE THAT WAS STATISTICALLY NO DIFFERENT THAN THE OTHER DEEP LEARNING MODELS. CONCLUSION: THIS SUPERVISED DEEP LEARNING APPROACH PERFORMS EXCEEDINGLY WELL FOR THE DETECTION OF AMS SYMPTOMS IN CLINICAL TEXT IN OUR ENVIRONMENT. FURTHER WORK IS NEEDED FOR THE GENERALIZABILITY OF THESE FINDINGS, INCLUDING EVALUATION OF THESE MODELS IN OTHER TYPES OF CLINICAL NOTES AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTS. THE RESULTS SEEM PROMISING FOR THE ULTIMATE USE OF THESE TYPES OF CLASSIFIERS IN COMBINATION WITH OTHER INFORMATION DERIVED FROM THE ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS AS INPUT FOR CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
AUTOMATED IDENTIFICATION OF PATIENTS WITH IMMUNE-RELATED ADVERSE EVENTS FROM CLINICAL NOTES USING WORD EMBEDDING AND MACHINE LEARNING. PURPOSE: ALTHOUGH IMMUNE CHECKPOINT INHIBITORS (ICIS) HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY IMPROVED SURVIVAL IN PATIENTS WITH ADVANCED MALIGNANCIES, THEY ARE ASSOCIATED WITH A UNIQUE SPECTRUM OF SIDE EFFECTS TERMED IMMUNE-RELATED ADVERSE EVENTS (IRAES). TO ENSURE TREATMENT SAFETY, RESEARCH EFFORTS ARE NEEDED TO COMPREHENSIVELY DETECT AND UNDERSTAND IRAES. RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS OF DATA FROM ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS CAN PROVIDE KNOWLEDGE TO CHARACTERIZE THESE TOXICITIES. HOWEVER, SUCH INFORMATION IS NOT CAPTURED IN A STRUCTURED FORMAT WITHIN THE ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD AND REQUIRES MANUAL CHART REVIEW. MATERIALS AND METHODS: IN THIS WORK, WE PROPOSE A NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING PIPELINE THAT CAN AUTOMATICALLY ANNOTATE CLINICAL NOTES AND DETERMINE WHETHER THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT A PATIENT DEVELOPED AN IRAE. SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY-ONE CASES WERE MANUALLY REVIEWED BY CLINICIANS AND ANNOTATED FOR IRAES AT THE PATIENT LEVEL. A DICTIONARY OF IRAES KEYWORDS WAS USED TO PERFORM TEXT REDUCTION ON CLINICAL NOTES BELONGING TO EACH PATIENT; ONLY SENTENCES WITH RELEVANT EXPRESSIONS WERE KEPT. WORD EMBEDDINGS WERE THEN USED TO GENERATE VECTOR REPRESENTATIONS OVER THE REDUCED TEXT, WHICH SERVED AS INPUT FOR THE MACHINE LEARNING CLASSIFIERS. THE OUTPUT OF THE MODELS WAS PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ANY IRAES. ADDITIONAL MODELS WERE BUILT TO CLASSIFY SKIN-RELATED TOXICITIES, ENDOCRINE TOXICITIES, AND COLITIS. RESULTS: THE MODEL FOR ANY IRAE ACHIEVED AN AVERAGE F1-SCORE = 0.75 AND AREA UNDER THE RECEIVER OPERATING CHARACTERISTIC CURVE = 0.85. THIS OUTPERFORMED A BASIC KEYWORD FILTERING APPROACH. ALTHOUGH THE CLASSIFIER OF ANY IRAES ACHIEVED GOOD ACCURACY, INDIVIDUAL IRAE CLASSIFICATION STILL HAS ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT. CONCLUSION: WE DEMONSTRATE THAT PATIENT-LEVEL ANNOTATIONS COMBINED WITH A MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH USING KEYWORDS FILTERING AND WORD EMBEDDINGS CAN ACHIEVE PROMISING ACCURACY IN CLASSIFYING IRAES IN CLINICAL NOTES. THIS MODEL MAY FACILITATE ANNOTATION AND ANALYSIS OF LARGE IRAES DATA SETS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
AUTOMATED TEXT ANALYSIS BASED ON SKIP-GRAM MODEL FOR FOOD EVALUATION IN PREDICTING CONSUMER ACCEPTANCE. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO EVALUATE FOOD TASTE, SMELL, AND CHARACTERISTICS FROM CONSUMERS' ONLINE REVIEWS. SEVERAL STUDIES IN FOOD SENSORY EVALUATION HAVE BEEN PRESENTED FOR CONSUMER ACCEPTANCE. HOWEVER, THESE STUDIES NEED TASTE DESCRIPTIVE WORD LEXICON, AND THEY ARE NOT SUITABLE FOR ANALYZING LARGE NUMBER OF EVALUATORS TO PREDICT CONSUMER ACCEPTANCE. IN THIS PAPER, AN AUTOMATED TEXT ANALYSIS METHOD FOR FOOD EVALUATION IS PRESENTED TO ANALYZE AND COMPARE RECENTLY INTRODUCED TWO JJAMPONG RAMEN TYPES (MIXED SEAFOOD NOODLES). TO AVOID BUILDING A SENSORY WORD LEXICON, CONSUMERS' REVIEWS ARE COLLECTED FROM SNS. THEN, BY TRAINING WORD EMBEDDING MODEL WITH ACQUIRED REVIEWS, WORDS IN THE LARGE AMOUNT OF REVIEW TEXT ARE CONVERTED INTO VECTORS. BASED ON THESE WORDS REPRESENTED AS VECTORS, INFERENCE IS PERFORMED TO EVALUATE TASTE AND SMELL OF TWO JJAMPONG RAMEN TYPES. FINALLY, THE RELIABILITY AND MERITS OF THE PROPOSED FOOD EVALUATION METHOD ARE CONFIRMED BY A COMPARISON WITH THE RESULTS FROM AN ACTUAL CONSUMER PREFERENCE TASTE EVALUATION.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
AUTOMATIC ANNOTATION OF NARRATIVE RADIOLOGY REPORTS. NARRATIVE TEXTS IN ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS CAN BE EFFICIENTLY UTILIZED FOR BUILDING DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS IN THE CLINIC, ONLY IF THEY ARE CORRECTLY INTERPRETED AUTOMATICALLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH A SPECIFIED STANDARD. THIS PAPER TACKLES THE PROBLEM OF DEVELOPING AN AUTOMATED METHOD OF LABELING FREE-FORM RADIOLOGY REPORTS, AS A PRECURSOR FOR BUILDING QUERY-CAPABLE REPORT DATABASES IN HOSPITALS. THE ANALYZED DATASET CONSISTS OF 1295 RADIOLOGY REPORTS CONCERNING THE CONDITION OF A KNEE, RETROSPECTIVELY GATHERED AT THE CLINICAL HOSPITAL CENTRE RIJEKA, CROATIA. REPORTS WERE MANUALLY LABELED WITH ONE OR MORE LABELS FROM A SET OF 10 MOST COMMONLY OCCURRING CLINICAL CONDITIONS. AFTER PRIMARY PREPROCESSING OF THE TEXTS, TWO SETS OF TEXT CLASSIFICATION METHODS WERE COMPARED: (1) TRADITIONAL CLASSIFICATION MODELS-NAIVE BAYES (NB), LOGISTIC REGRESSION (LR), SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE (SVM), AND RANDOM FORESTS (RF)-COUPLED WITH BAG-OF-WORDS (BOW) FEATURES (I.E., SYMBOLIC TEXT REPRESENTATION) AND (2) CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (CNN) COUPLED WITH DENSE WORD VECTORS (I.E., WORD EMBEDDINGS AS A SEMANTIC TEXT REPRESENTATION) AS INPUT FEATURES. WE RESORTED TO NESTED 10-FOLD CROSS-VALIDATION TO EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE OF COMPETING METHODS USING ACCURACY, PRECISION, RECALL, AND F 1 SCORE. THE CNN WITH SEMANTIC WORD REPRESENTATIONS AS INPUT YIELDED THE OVERALL BEST PERFORMANCE, HAVING A MICRO-AVERAGED F 1 SCORE OF 86 . 7 % . THE CNN CLASSIFIER YIELDED PARTICULARLY ENCOURAGING RESULTS FOR THE MOST REPRESENTED CONDITIONS: DEGENERATIVE DISEASE ( 95 . 9 % ), ARTHROSIS ( 93 . 3 % ), AND INJURY ( 89 . 2 % ). AS A DATA-HUNGRY DEEP LEARNING MODEL, THE CNN, HOWEVER, PERFORMED NOTABLY WORSE THAN THE COMPETING MODELS ON UNDERREPRESENTED CLASSES WITH FEWER TRAINING INSTANCES SUCH AS MULTICAUSAL DISEASE OR METABOLIC DISEASE. LR, RF, AND SVM PERFORMED COMPARABLY WELL, WITH THE OBTAINED MICRO-AVERAGED F 1 SCORES OF 84 . 6 % , 82 . 2 % , AND 82 . 1 % , RESPECTIVELY.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
AUTOMATIC CLASSIFICATION OF THYROID FINDINGS USING STATIC AND CONTEXTUALIZED ENSEMBLE NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING SYSTEMS: DEVELOPMENT STUDY. BACKGROUND: IN THE CASE OF KOREAN INSTITUTIONS AND ENTERPRISES THAT COLLECT NONSTANDARDIZED AND NONUNIFIED FORMATS OF ELECTRONIC MEDICAL EXAMINATION RESULTS FROM MULTIPLE MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS, A GROUP OF EXPERIENCED NURSES WHO CAN UNDERSTAND THE RESULTS AND RELATED CONTEXTS INITIALLY CLASSIFIED THE REPORTS MANUALLY. THE CLASSIFICATION GUIDELINES WERE ESTABLISHED BY YEARS OF WORKERS' CLINICAL EXPERIENCES AND THERE WERE ATTEMPTS TO AUTOMATE THE CLASSIFICATION WORK. HOWEVER, THERE HAVE BEEN PROBLEMS IN WHICH RULE-BASED ALGORITHMS OR HUMAN LABOR-INTENSIVE EFFORTS CAN BE TIME-CONSUMING OR LIMITED OWING TO HIGH POTENTIAL ERRORS. WE INVESTIGATED NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) ARCHITECTURES AND PROPOSED ENSEMBLE MODELS TO CREATE AUTOMATED CLASSIFIERS. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY AIMED TO DEVELOP PRACTICAL DEEP LEARNING MODELS WITH ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS FROM 284 HEALTH CARE INSTITUTIONS AND OPEN-SOURCE CORPUS DATA SETS FOR AUTOMATICALLY CLASSIFYING 3 THYROID CONDITIONS: HEALTHY, CAUTION REQUIRED, AND CRITICAL. THE PRIMARY GOAL IS TO INCREASE THE OVERALL ACCURACY OF THE CLASSIFICATION, YET THERE ARE PRACTICAL AND INDUSTRIAL NEEDS TO CORRECTLY PREDICT HEALTHY (NEGATIVE) THYROID CONDITION DATA, WHICH ARE MOSTLY MEDICAL EXAMINATION RESULTS, AND MINIMIZE FALSE-NEGATIVE RATES UNDER THE PREDICTION OF HEALTHY THYROID CONDITIONS. METHODS: THE DATA SETS INCLUDED THYROID AND COMPREHENSIVE MEDICAL EXAMINATION REPORTS. THE TEXTUAL DATA ARE NOT ONLY DOCUMENTED IN FULLY COMPLETE SENTENCES BUT ALSO WRITTEN IN LISTS OF WORDS OR PHRASES. THEREFORE, WE PROPOSE STATIC AND CONTEXTUALIZED ENSEMBLE NLP NETWORK (SCENT) SYSTEMS TO SUCCESSFULLY REFLECT STATIC AND CONTEXTUAL INFORMATION AND HANDLE INCOMPLETE SENTENCES. WE PREPARED EACH CONVOLUTION NEURAL NETWORK (CNN)-, LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY (LSTM)-, AND EFFICIENTLY LEARNING AN ENCODER THAT CLASSIFIES TOKEN REPLACEMENTS ACCURATELY (ELECTRA)-BASED ENSEMBLE MODEL BY TRAINING OR FINE-TUNING THEM MULTIPLE TIMES. THROUGH COMPREHENSIVE EXPERIMENTS, WE PROPOSE 2 VERSIONS OF ENSEMBLE MODELS, SCENT-V1 AND SCENT-V2, WITH THE SINGLE-ARCHITECTURE-BASED CNN, LSTM, AND ELECTRA ENSEMBLE MODELS FOR THE BEST CLASSIFICATION PERFORMANCE AND PRACTICAL USE, RESPECTIVELY. SCENT-V1 IS AN ENSEMBLE OF CNN AND ELECTRA ENSEMBLE MODELS, AND SCENT-V2 IS A HIERARCHICAL ENSEMBLE OF CNN, LSTM, AND ELECTRA ENSEMBLE MODELS. SCENT-V2 FIRST CLASSIFIES THE 3 LABELS USING AN ELECTRA ENSEMBLE MODEL AND THEN RECLASSIFIES THEM USING AN ENSEMBLE MODEL OF CNN AND LSTM IF THE ELECTRA ENSEMBLE MODEL PREDICTED THEM AS "HEALTHY" LABELS. RESULTS: SCENT-V1 OUTPERFORMED ALL THE SUGGESTED MODELS, WITH THE HIGHEST F1 SCORE (92.56%). SCENT-V2 HAD THE SECOND-HIGHEST RECALL VALUE (94.44%) AND THE FEWEST MISCLASSIFICATIONS FOR CAUTION-REQUIRED THYROID CONDITION WHILE MAINTAINING 0 CLASSIFICATION ERROR FOR THE CRITICAL THYROID CONDITION UNDER THE PREDICTION OF THE HEALTHY THYROID CONDITION. CONCLUSIONS: THE PROPOSED SCENT DEMONSTRATES GOOD CLASSIFICATION PERFORMANCE DESPITE THE UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE KOREAN LANGUAGE AND PROBLEMS OF DATA LACK AND IMBALANCE, ESPECIALLY FOR THE EXTREMELY LOW AMOUNT OF CRITICAL CONDITION DATA. THE RESULT OF SCENT-V1 INDICATES THAT DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES OF STATIC AND CONTEXTUAL INPUT TOKEN REPRESENTATIONS CAN ENHANCE CLASSIFICATION PERFORMANCE. SCENT-V2 HAS A STRONG IMPACT ON THE PREDICTION OF HEALTHY THYROID CONDITIONS.             
AUTOMATIC DEPRESSION SCORE ESTIMATION WITH WORD EMBEDDING MODELS. DEPRESSION IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON MENTAL HEALTH ILLNESSES. THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE LIES IN AN EFFICIENT AND EARLY DETECTION OF THE DISORDER. SELF-REPORT QUESTIONNAIRES ARE THE INSTRUMENTS USED BY MEDICAL EXPERTS TO ELABORATE A DIAGNOSIS. THESE QUESTIONNAIRES WERE DESIGNED BY ANALYZING DIFFERENT DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS. HOWEVER, FACTORS SUCH AS SOCIAL STIGMAS NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE SUCCESS OF TRADITIONAL METHODS. THIS PAPER PRESENTS A NOVEL APPROACH FOR AUTOMATICALLY ESTIMATING THE DEGREE OF DEPRESSION IN SOCIAL MEDIA USERS. IN THIS REGARD, WE ADDRESSED THE TASK MEASURING THE SEVERITY OF THE SIGNS OF DEPRESSION OF ERISK 2020, AN INITIATIVE IN THE CLEF CONFERENCE. WE AIMED TO EXPLORE NEURAL LANGUAGE MODELS TO EXPLOIT DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE SUBJECT'S WRITINGS DEPENDING ON THE SYMPTOM TO CAPTURE. WE DEVISED TWO DISTINCT METHODS BASED ON THE SYMPTOMS' SENSITIVITY IN TERMS OF WILLINGNESS ON COMMENTING ABOUT THEM PUBLICLY. THE FIRST EXPLOITS USERS' GENERAL LANGUAGE BASED ON THEIR PUBLICATIONS. THE SECOND SEEKS MORE DIRECT EVIDENCE FROM PUBLICATIONS THAT SPECIFICALLY MENTION THE SYMPTOMS CONCERNS. BOTH METHODS AUTOMATICALLY ESTIMATE THE BECK DEPRESSION INVENTORY (BDI-II) TOTAL SCORE. FOR EVALUATING OUR PROPOSALS, WE USED BENCHMARK REDDIT DATA FOR DEPRESSION SEVERITY ESTIMATION. OUR FINDINGS SHOWED THAT APPROACHES BASED ON NEURAL LANGUAGE MODELS ARE A FEASIBLE ALTERNATIVE FOR ESTIMATING DEPRESSION RATING SCALES, EVEN WHEN SMALL AMOUNTS OF TRAINING DATA ARE AVAILABLE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
AUTOMATIC EXTRACTION OF GENE-DISEASE ASSOCIATIONS FROM LITERATURE USING JOINT ENSEMBLE LEARNING. A WEALTH OF KNOWLEDGE CONCERNING RELATIONS BETWEEN GENES AND ITS ASSOCIATED DISEASES IS PRESENT IN BIOMEDICAL LITERATURE. MINING THESE BIOLOGICAL ASSOCIATIONS FROM LITERATURE CAN PROVIDE IMMENSE SUPPORT TO RESEARCH RANGING FROM DRUG-TARGETABLE PATHWAYS TO BIOMARKER DISCOVERY. HOWEVER, TIME AND COST OF MANUAL CURATION HEAVILY SLOWS IT DOWN. IN THIS CURRENT SCENARIO ONE OF THE CRUCIAL TECHNOLOGIES IS BIOMEDICAL TEXT MINING, AND RELATION EXTRACTION SHOWS THE PROMISING RESULT TO EXPLORE THE RESEARCH OF GENES ASSOCIATED WITH DISEASES. BY DEVELOPING AUTOMATIC EXTRACTION OF GENE-DISEASE ASSOCIATIONS FROM THE LITERATURE USING JOINT ENSEMBLE LEARNING WE ADDRESSED THIS PROBLEM FROM A TEXT MINING PERSPECTIVE. IN THE PROPOSED WORK, WE EMPLOY A SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH IN WHICH A RICH FEATURE SET COVERING CONCEPTUAL, SYNTAX AND SEMANTIC PROPERTIES JOINTLY LEARNED WITH WORD EMBEDDING ARE TRAINED USING ENSEMBLE SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE FOR EXTRACTING GENE-DISEASE RELATIONS FROM FOUR GOLD STANDARD CORPORA. UPON EVALUATING THE MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH SHOWS PROMISED RESULTS OF 85.34%, 83.93%,87.39% AND 85.57% OF F-MEASURE ON EUADR, GAD, COMAGC AND POLYSEARCH CORPORA RESPECTIVELY. WE STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT THE PRESENTED NOVEL APPROACH COMBINING RICH SYNTAX AND SEMANTIC FEATURE SET WITH DOMAIN-SPECIFIC WORD EMBEDDING THROUGH ENSEMBLE SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES EVALUATED ON FOUR GOLD STANDARD CORPORA CAN ACT AS A NEW BASELINE FOR FUTURE WORKS IN GENE-DISEASE RELATION EXTRACTION FROM LITERATURE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
AUTOMATIC INFORMATION EXTRACTION FROM UNSTRUCTURED MAMMOGRAPHY REPORTS USING DISTRIBUTED SEMANTICS. TO DATE, THE METHODS DEVELOPED FOR AUTOMATED EXTRACTION OF INFORMATION FROM RADIOLOGY REPORTS ARE MAINLY RULE-BASED OR DICTIONARY-BASED, AND, THEREFORE, REQUIRE SUBSTANTIAL MANUAL EFFORT TO BUILD THESE SYSTEMS. RECENT EFFORTS TO DEVELOP AUTOMATED SYSTEMS FOR ENTITY DETECTION HAVE BEEN UNDERTAKEN, BUT LITTLE WORK HAS BEEN DONE TO AUTOMATICALLY EXTRACT RELATIONS AND THEIR ASSOCIATED NAMED ENTITIES IN NARRATIVE RADIOLOGY REPORTS THAT HAVE COMPARABLE ACCURACY TO RULE-BASED METHODS. OUR GOAL IS TO EXTRACT RELATIONS IN A UNSUPERVISED WAY FROM RADIOLOGY REPORTS WITHOUT SPECIFYING PRIOR DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE. WE PROPOSE A HYBRID APPROACH FOR INFORMATION EXTRACTION THAT COMBINES DEPENDENCY-BASED PARSE TREE WITH DISTRIBUTED SEMANTICS FOR GENERATING STRUCTURED INFORMATION FRAMES ABOUT PARTICULAR FINDINGS/ABNORMALITIES FROM THE FREE-TEXT MAMMOGRAPHY REPORTS. THE PROPOSED IE SYSTEM OBTAINS A F1-SCORE OF 0.94 IN TERMS OF COMPLETENESS OF THE CONTENT IN THE INFORMATION FRAMES, WHICH OUTPERFORMS A STATE-OF-THE-ART RULE-BASED SYSTEM IN THIS DOMAIN BY A SIGNIFICANT MARGIN. THE PROPOSED SYSTEM CAN BE LEVERAGED IN A VARIETY OF APPLICATIONS, SUCH AS DECISION SUPPORT AND INFORMATION RETRIEVAL, AND MAY ALSO EASILY SCALE TO OTHER RADIOLOGY DOMAINS, SINCE THERE IS NO NEED TO TUNE THE SYSTEM WITH HAND-CRAFTED INFORMATION EXTRACTION RULES.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
AUTOMATIC INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASES CODING SYSTEM: DEEP CONTEXTUALIZED LANGUAGE MODEL WITH RULE-BASED APPROACHES. BACKGROUND: THE TENTH REVISION OF THE INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASES (ICD-10) IS WIDELY USED FOR EPIDEMIOLOGICAL RESEARCH AND HEALTH MANAGEMENT. THE CLINICAL MODIFICATION (CM) AND PROCEDURE CODING SYSTEM (PCS) OF ICD-10 WERE DEVELOPED TO DESCRIBE MORE CLINICAL DETAILS WITH INCREASING DIAGNOSIS AND PROCEDURE CODES AND APPLIED IN DISEASE-RELATED GROUPS FOR REIMBURSEMENT. THE EXPANSION OF CODES MADE THE CODING TIME-CONSUMING AND LESS ACCURATE. THE STATE-OF-THE-ART MODEL USING DEEP CONTEXTUAL WORD EMBEDDINGS WAS USED FOR AUTOMATIC MULTILABEL TEXT CLASSIFICATION OF ICD-10. IN ADDITION TO INPUT DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES (DD), THE PERFORMANCE CAN BE IMPROVED BY APPROPRIATE PREPROCESSING METHODS FOR THE TEXT FROM OTHER DOCUMENT TYPES, SUCH AS MEDICAL HISTORY, COMORBIDITY AND COMPLICATION, SURGICAL METHOD, AND SPECIAL EXAMINATION. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY AIMS TO ESTABLISH A CONTEXTUAL LANGUAGE MODEL WITH RULE-BASED PREPROCESSING METHODS TO DEVELOP THE MODEL FOR ICD-10 MULTILABEL CLASSIFICATION. METHODS: WE RETRIEVED ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS FROM A MEDICAL CENTER. WE FIRST COMPARED DIFFERENT WORD EMBEDDING METHODS. SECOND, WE COMPARED THE PREPROCESSING METHODS USING THE BEST-PERFORMING EMBEDDINGS. WE COMPARED BIOMEDICAL BIDIRECTIONAL ENCODER REPRESENTATIONS FROM TRANSFORMERS (BIOBERT), CLINICAL GENERALIZED AUTOREGRESSIVE PRETRAINING FOR LANGUAGE UNDERSTANDING (CLINICAL XLNET), LABEL TREE-BASED ATTENTION-AWARE DEEP MODEL FOR HIGH-PERFORMANCE EXTREME MULTILABEL TEXT CLASSIFICATION (ATTENTIONXLM), AND WORD-TO-VECTOR (WORD2VEC) TO PREDICT ICD-10-CM. TO COMPARE DIFFERENT PREPROCESSING METHODS FOR ICD-10-CM, WE INCLUDED DD, MEDICAL HISTORY, AND COMORBIDITY AND COMPLICATION AS INPUTS. WE COMPARED THE PERFORMANCE OF ICD-10-CM PREDICTION USING DIFFERENT PREPROCESSES, INCLUDING DEFINITION TRAINING, EXTERNAL CAUSE CODE REMOVAL, NUMBER CONVERSION, AND COMBINATION CODE FILTERING. FOR THE ICD-10 PCS, THE MODEL WAS TRAINED USING DIFFERENT COMBINATIONS OF DD, SURGICAL METHOD, AND KEY WORDS OF SPECIAL EXAMINATION. THE MICRO F1 SCORE AND THE MICRO AREA UNDER THE RECEIVER OPERATING CHARACTERISTIC CURVE WERE USED TO COMPARE THE MODEL'S PERFORMANCE WITH THAT OF DIFFERENT PREPROCESSING METHODS. RESULTS: BIOBERT HAD AN F1 SCORE OF 0.701 AND OUTPERFORMED OTHER MODELS SUCH AS CLINICAL XLNET, ATTENTIONXLM, AND WORD2VEC. FOR THE ICD-10-CM, THE MODEL HAD AN F1 SCORE THAT SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED FROM 0.749 (95% CI 0.744-0.753) TO 0.769 (95% CI 0.764-0.773) WITH THE ICD-10 DEFINITION TRAINING, EXTERNAL CAUSE CODE REMOVAL, NUMBER CONVERSION, AND COMBINATION CODE FILTER. FOR THE ICD-10-PCS, THE MODEL HAD AN F1 SCORE THAT SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED FROM 0.670 (95% CI 0.663-0.678) TO 0.726 (95% CI 0.719-0.732) WITH A COMBINATION OF DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES, SURGICAL METHODS, AND KEY WORDS OF SPECIAL EXAMINATION. WITH OUR PREPROCESSING METHODS, THE MODEL HAD THE HIGHEST AREA UNDER THE RECEIVER OPERATING CHARACTERISTIC CURVE OF 0.853 (95% CI 0.849-0.855) AND 0.831 (95% CI 0.827-0.834) FOR ICD-10-CM AND ICD-10-PCS, RESPECTIVELY. CONCLUSIONS: THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR MODEL WITH THE PRETRAINED CONTEXTUALIZED LANGUAGE MODEL AND RULE-BASED PREPROCESSING METHOD IS BETTER THAN THAT OF THE STATE-OF-THE-ART MODEL FOR ICD-10-CM OR ICD-10-PCS. THIS STUDY HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPORTANCE OF RULE-BASED PREPROCESSING METHODS BASED ON CODER CODING RULES.                                                                 
AUTOMATIC NORMALIZATION OF ANATOMICAL PHRASES IN RADIOLOGY REPORTS USING UNSUPERVISED LEARNING. IN TODAY'S RADIOLOGY WORKFLOW, FREE-TEXT REPORTING IS ESTABLISHED AS THE MOST COMMON MEDIUM TO CAPTURE, STORE, AND COMMUNICATE CLINICAL INFORMATION. RADIOLOGISTS ROUTINELY REFER TO PRIOR RADIOLOGY REPORTS OF A PATIENT TO RECALL CRITICAL INFORMATION FOR NEW DIAGNOSIS, WHICH IS QUITE TEDIOUS, TIME CONSUMING, AND PRONE TO HUMAN ERROR. AUTOMATIC STRUCTURING OF REPORT CONTENT IS DESIRED TO FACILITATE SUCH INQUIRY OF INFORMATION. IN THIS WORK, WE PROPOSE AN UNSUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH TO AUTOMATICALLY STRUCTURE RADIOLOGY REPORTS BY DETECTING AND NORMALIZING ANATOMICAL PHRASES BASED ON THE SYSTEMATIZED NOMENCLATURE OF MEDICINE-CLINICAL TERMS (SNOMED CT) ONTOLOGY. THE PROPOSED APPROACH COMBINES WORD EMBEDDING-BASED SEMANTIC LEARNING WITH ONTOLOGY-BASED CONCEPT MAPPING TO DERIVE THE DESIRED CONCEPT NORMALIZATION. THE WORD EMBEDDING MODEL WAS TRAINED USING A LARGE CORPUS OF UNLABELED RADIOLOGY REPORTS. FIFTY-SIX ANATOMICAL LABELS WERE EXTRACTED FROM SNOMED CT AS CLASS LABELS OF THE WHOLE HUMAN ANATOMY. THE PROPOSED FRAMEWORK WAS COMPARED AGAINST A NUMBER OF STATE-OF-THE-ART SUPERVISED AND UNSUPERVISED APPROACHES. RADIOLOGY REPORTS FROM THREE DIFFERENT CLINICAL SITES WERE MANUALLY LABELED FOR TESTING. THE PROPOSED APPROACH OUTPERFORMED OTHER TECHNIQUES YIELDING AN AVERAGE PRECISION OF 82.6%. THE PROPOSED FRAMEWORK BOOSTS THE COVERAGE AND PERFORMANCE OF CONVENTIONAL APPROACHES FOR CONCEPT NORMALIZATION, BY APPLYING WORD EMBEDDING TECHNIQUES IN SEMANTIC LEARNING, WHILE AVOIDING THE CHALLENGE OF HAVING ACCESS TO A LARGE AMOUNT OF ANNOTATED DATA, WHICH IS TYPICALLY REQUIRED FOR TRAINING CLASSIFIERS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
AUTOMATIC PREDICTION OF RECURRENCE OF MAJOR CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS: A TEXT MINING STUDY USING CHEST X-RAY REPORTS. METHODS: WE USED EHR DATA OF PATIENTS INCLUDED IN THE SECOND MANIFESTATIONS OF ARTERIAL DISEASE (SMART) STUDY. WE PROPOSE A DEEP LEARNING-BASED MULTIMODAL ARCHITECTURE FOR OUR TEXT MINING PIPELINE THAT INTEGRATES NEURAL TEXT REPRESENTATION WITH PREPROCESSED CLINICAL PREDICTORS FOR THE PREDICTION OF RECURRENCE OF MAJOR CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS IN CARDIOVASCULAR PATIENTS. TEXT PREPROCESSING, INCLUDING CLEANING AND STEMMING, WAS FIRST APPLIED TO FILTER OUT THE UNWANTED TEXTS FROM X-RAY RADIOLOGY REPORTS. THEREAFTER, TEXT REPRESENTATION METHODS WERE USED TO NUMERICALLY REPRESENT UNSTRUCTURED RADIOLOGY REPORTS WITH VECTORS. SUBSEQUENTLY, THESE TEXT REPRESENTATION METHODS WERE ADDED TO PREDICTION MODELS TO ASSESS THEIR CLINICAL RELEVANCE. IN THIS STEP, WE APPLIED LOGISTIC REGRESSION, SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE (SVM), MULTILAYER PERCEPTRON NEURAL NETWORK, CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK, LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY (LSTM), AND BIDIRECTIONAL LSTM DEEP NEURAL NETWORK (BILSTM). RESULTS: WE PERFORMED VARIOUS EXPERIMENTS TO EVALUATE THE ADDED VALUE OF THE TEXT IN THE PREDICTION OF MAJOR CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS. THE TWO MAIN SCENARIOS WERE THE INTEGRATION OF RADIOLOGY REPORTS (1) WITH CLASSICAL CLINICAL PREDICTORS AND (2) WITH ONLY AGE AND SEX IN THE CASE OF UNAVAILABLE CLINICAL PREDICTORS. IN TOTAL, DATA OF 5603 PATIENTS WERE USED WITH 5-FOLD CROSS-VALIDATION TO TRAIN THE MODELS. IN THE FIRST SCENARIO, THE MULTIMODAL BILSTM (MI-BILSTM) MODEL ACHIEVED AN AREA UNDER THE CURVE (AUC) OF 84.7%, MISCLASSIFICATION RATE OF 14.3%, AND F1 SCORE OF 83.8%. IN THIS SCENARIO, THE SVM MODEL, TRAINED ON CLINICAL VARIABLES AND BAG-OF-WORDS REPRESENTATION, ACHIEVED THE LOWEST MISCLASSIFICATION RATE OF 12.2%. IN THE CASE OF UNAVAILABLE CLINICAL PREDICTORS, THE MI-BILSTM MODEL TRAINED ON RADIOLOGY REPORTS AND DEMOGRAPHIC (AGE AND SEX) VARIABLES REACHED AN AUC, F1 SCORE, AND MISCLASSIFICATION RATE OF 74.5%, 70.8%, AND 20.4%, RESPECTIVELY. CONCLUSIONS: USING THE CASE STUDY OF ROUTINE CARE CHEST X-RAY RADIOLOGY REPORTS, WE DEMONSTRATED THE CLINICAL RELEVANCE OF INTEGRATING TEXT FEATURES AND CLASSICAL PREDICTORS IN OUR TEXT MINING PIPELINE FOR CARDIOVASCULAR RISK PREDICTION. THE MI-BILSTM MODEL WITH WORD EMBEDDING REPRESENTATION APPEARED TO HAVE A DESIRABLE PERFORMANCE WHEN TRAINED ON TEXT DATA INTEGRATED WITH THE CLINICAL VARIABLES FROM THE SMART STUDY. OUR RESULTS MINED FROM CHEST X-RAY REPORTS SHOWED THAT MODELS USING TEXT DATA IN ADDITION TO LABORATORY VALUES OUTPERFORM THOSE USING ONLY KNOWN CLINICAL PREDICTORS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
AUTOMATIC SNOMED CT CODING OF CHINESE CLINICAL TERMS VIA ATTENTION-BASED SEMANTIC MATCHING. BACKGROUND: A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF MEANINGFUL INFORMATION IS ROUTINELY RECORDED IN CHINESE CLINICAL DATA IN TEXT FORMAT, REFERRED TO AS CHINESE CLINICAL TERMS. THE LACK OF CODING IS A MAJOR DIFFICULTY HINDERING THE APPLICATION OF CLINICAL TERMS. SNOMED CT IS A WIDELY USED AND COMPREHENSIVE CLINICAL HEALTH CARE TERMINOLOGY COLLECTION BECAUSE OF ITS COVERAGE, GRANULARITY, CLINICAL ORIENTATION, AND LOGICAL UNDERPINNING. IT IS USEFUL AND EFFICIENT FOR AUTOMATICALLY ASSIGNING SNOMED CT CODES TO CHINESE CLINICAL TERMS, BUT IT STILL FACES SEVERAL PROBLEMS. CURRENT CROSS-LANGUAGE CLINICAL TERM MATCHING STUDIES RELY ON EXTERNAL RESOURCES, SUCH AS MACHINE TRANSLATION AND RULE-BASED METHODS. SEMANTIC MATCHING METHODS HAVE ACHIEVED STRONG PERFORMANCE ON TEXT MATCHING, BUT FEW STUDIES HAVE BEEN DONE ON CROSS-LANGUAGE CLINICAL TERM MATCHING. WE PRESENT AN EFFECTIVE ATTENTION-BASED SEMANTIC MATCHING ALGORITHM TO AUTOMATICALLY CROSS-LANGUAGE CODE CHINESE CLINICAL TERMS WITH SNOMED CT. METHOD: FIRSTLY, BERT WAS USED TO TURN THE INPUT INTO WORD EMBEDDING. THEN, THE WORD EMBEDDINGS WERE ENCODED THROUGH A BILSTM WITH SELF-ATTENTION TO FOCUS ON CAPTURING DISTANT RELATIONSHIPS AMONG WORDS WITH DIFFERENT WEIGHTS DEPENDING ON THEIR CONTRIBUTION TO SEMANTIC MATCHING. THEN, DECOMPOSABLE ATTENTION WAS USED TO MAKE SEMANTIC MATCHING TRIVIALLY PARALLELIZABLE TO SPEED UP CALCULATION. FINALLY, FULLY CONNECTED LAYERS AND A SIGMOID WERE UTILIZED TO OUTPUT MATCHING RESULTS. RESULTS: THE 29,960 MANUALLY CODED CHINESE CLINICAL TERMS, 30,040 UNMATCHED CHINESE CLINICAL TERMS AND SNOMED CT CODES WERE COLLECTED TO EVALUATE THE PROPOSED METHOD. COMPARED WITH THE EXISTING SEMANTIC MATCHING METHOD, THE PROPOSED APPROACH ACHIEVES STATE-OF-THE-ART RESULTS DEMONSTRATING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE METHOD WITH AN ACCURACY OF 0.905, A PRECISION OF 0.856, A RECALL OF 0.518, AND AN F-MEASURE OF 0.645. THE PROPOSED CHINESE-ENGLISH BILINGUAL TERM MAPPING, CHINESE CHARACTER-LEVEL AND WORD-LEVEL ENCODER, ENGLISH WORD-LEVEL ENCODER, BERT MODEL, AND ATTENTION MECHANISM PERFORMED BETTER THAN OTHER METHODS. CONCLUSION: THE PROPOSED AUTOMATIC SNOMED CT CODING APPROACH OF CHINESE CLINICAL TERMS VIA ATTENTION-BASED SEMANTIC MATCHING CAN IMPROVE THE PERFORMANCE OF AUTOMATED SNOMED CT CODE ASSIGNMENT FOR CHINESE CLINICAL TERMS AND IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY OF THE CODE ASSIGNMENT.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
AUTOMATIC STRUCTURING OF ONTOLOGY TERMS BASED ON LEXICAL GRANULARITY AND MACHINE LEARNING: ALGORITHM DEVELOPMENT AND VALIDATION. BACKGROUND: AS THE MANUAL CREATION AND MAINTENANCE OF BIOMEDICAL ONTOLOGIES ARE LABOR-INTENSIVE, AUTOMATIC AIDS ARE DESIRABLE IN THE LIFECYCLE OF ONTOLOGY DEVELOPMENT. OBJECTIVE: PROVIDED WITH A SET OF CONCEPT NAMES IN THE FOUNDATIONAL MODEL OF ANATOMY (FMA), WE PROPOSE AN INNOVATIVE METHOD FOR AUTOMATICALLY GENERATING THE TAXONOMY AND THE PARTONOMY STRUCTURES AMONG THEM, RESPECTIVELY. METHODS: OUR APPROACH COMPRISES 2 MAIN TASKS: THE FIRST TASK IS PREDICTING THE DIRECT RELATION BETWEEN 2 GIVEN CONCEPT NAMES BY UTILIZING WORD EMBEDDING METHODS AND TRAINING 2 MACHINE LEARNING MODELS, CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS (CNN) AND BIDIRECTIONAL LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY NETWORKS (BI-LSTM). THE SECOND TASK IS THE INTRODUCTION OF AN ORIGINAL GRANULARITY-BASED METHOD TO IDENTIFY THE SEMANTIC STRUCTURES AMONG A GROUP OF GIVEN CONCEPT NAMES BY LEVERAGING THESE TRAINED MODELS. RESULTS: RESULTS SHOW THAT BOTH CNN AND BI-LSTM PERFORM WELL ON THE FIRST TASK, WITH F1 MEASURES ABOVE 0.91. FOR THE SECOND TASK, OUR APPROACH ACHIEVES AN AVERAGE F1 MEASURE OF 0.79 ON 100 CASE STUDIES IN THE FMA USING BI-LSTM, WHICH OUTPERFORMS THE PRIMITIVE PAIRWISE-BASED METHOD. CONCLUSIONS: WE HAVE INVESTIGATED AN AUTOMATIC WAY OF PREDICTING A HIERARCHICAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN 2 CONCEPT NAMES; BASED ON THIS, WE HAVE FURTHER INVENTED A METHODOLOGY TO STRUCTURE A GROUP OF CONCEPT NAMES AUTOMATICALLY. THIS STUDY IS AN INITIAL INVESTIGATION THAT WILL SHED LIGHT ON FURTHER WORK ON THE AUTOMATIC CREATION AND ENRICHMENT OF BIOMEDICAL ONTOLOGIES.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
BENGSENTILEX AND BENGSWEARLEX: CREATING LEXICONS FOR SENTIMENT ANALYSIS AND PROFANITY DETECTION IN LOW-RESOURCE BENGALI LANGUAGE. BENGALI IS A LOW-RESOURCE LANGUAGE THAT LACKS TOOLS AND RESOURCES FOR VARIOUS NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) TASKS, SUCH AS SENTIMENT ANALYSIS OR PROFANITY IDENTIFICATION. IN BENGALI, ONLY THE TRANSLATED VERSIONS OF ENGLISH SENTIMENT LEXICONS ARE AVAILABLE. MOREOVER, NO DICTIONARY EXISTS FOR DETECTING PROFANITY IN BENGALI SOCIAL MEDIA TEXT. THIS STUDY INTRODUCES A BENGALI SENTIMENT LEXICON, BENGSENTILEX, AND A BENGALI SWEAR LEXICON, BENGSWEARLEX. FOR CREATING BENGSENTILEX, A CROSS-LINGUAL METHODOLOGY IS PROPOSED THAT UTILIZES A MACHINE TRANSLATION SYSTEM, A REVIEW CORPUS, TWO ENGLISH SENTIMENT LEXICONS, POINTWISE MUTUAL INFORMATION (PMI), AND SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING (ML) CLASSIFIERS IN VARIOUS STAGES. A SEMI-AUTOMATIC METHODOLOGY IS PRESENTED TO DEVELOP BENGSWEARLEX THAT LEVERAGES AN OBSCENE CORPUS, WORD EMBEDDING, AND PART-OF-SPEECH (POS) TAGGERS. THE PERFORMANCE OF BENGSENTILEX COMPARED WITH THE TRANSLATED ENGLISH LEXICONS IN THREE EVALUATION DATASETS. BENGSENTILEX ACHIEVES 5%-50% IMPROVEMENT OVER THE TRANSLATED LEXICONS. FOR IDENTIFYING PROFANITY, BENGSWEARLEX ACHIEVES DOCUMENTLEVEL COVERAGE OF AROUND 85% IN AN DOCUMENT-LEVEL IN THE EVALUATION DATASET. THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS IMPLY THAT BENGSENTILEX AND BENGSWEARLEX ARE EFFECTIVE RESOURCES FOR CLASSIFYING SENTIMENT AND IDENTIFYING PROFANITY IN BENGALI SOCIAL MEDIA CONTENT, RESPECTIVELY.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
BERT-PROMOTER: AN IMPROVED SEQUENCE-BASED PREDICTOR OF DNA PROMOTER USING BERT PRE-TRAINED MODEL AND SHAP FEATURE SELECTION. A PROMOTER IS A SEQUENCE OF DNA THAT INITIALIZES THE PROCESS OF TRANSCRIPTION AND REGULATES WHENEVER AND WHEREVER GENES ARE EXPRESSED IN THE ORGANISM. BECAUSE OF ITS IMPORTANCE IN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY, IDENTIFYING DNA PROMOTERS ARE CHALLENGING TO PROVIDE USEFUL INFORMATION RELATED TO ITS FUNCTIONS AND RELATED DISEASES. SEVERAL COMPUTATIONAL MODELS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED TO EARLY PREDICT PROMOTERS FROM HIGH-THROUGHPUT SEQUENCING OVER THE PAST DECADE. ALTHOUGH SOME USEFUL PREDICTORS HAVE BEEN PROPOSED, THERE REMAINS SHORT-FALLS IN THOSE MODELS AND THERE IS AN URGENT NEED TO ENHANCE THE PREDICTIVE PERFORMANCE TO MEET THE PRACTICE REQUIREMENTS. IN THIS STUDY, WE PROPOSED A NOVEL ARCHITECTURE THAT INCORPORATED TRANSFORMER NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) AND EXPLAINABLE MACHINE LEARNING TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM. MORE SPECIFICALLY, A PRE-TRAINED BIDIRECTIONAL ENCODER REPRESENTATIONS FROM TRANSFORMERS (BERT) MODEL WAS EMPLOYED TO ENCODE DNA SEQUENCES, AND SHAPLEY ADDITIVE EXPLANATIONS (SHAP) ANALYSIS SERVED AS A FEATURE SELECTION STEP TO LOOK AT THE TOP-RANK BERT ENCODINGS. AT THE LAST STAGE, DIFFERENT MACHINE LEARNING CLASSIFIERS WERE IMPLEMENTED TO LEARN THE TOP FEATURES AND PRODUCE THE PREDICTION OUTCOMES. THIS STUDY NOT ONLY PREDICTED THE DNA PROMOTERS BUT ALSO THEIR ACTIVITIES (STRONG OR WEAK PROMOTERS). OVERALL, SEVERAL EXPERIMENTS SHOWED AN ACCURACY OF 85.5 % AND 76.9 % FOR THESE TWO LEVELS, RESPECTIVELY. OUR PERFORMANCE SHOWED A SUPERIORITY TO PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED PREDICTORS ON THE SAME DATASET IN MOST MEASUREMENT METRICS. WE NAMED OUR PREDICTOR AS BERT-PROMOTER AND IT IS FREELY AVAILABLE AT HTTPS://GITHUB.COM/KHANHLEE/BERT-PROMOTER.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
BETTER SYNONYMS FOR ENRICHING BIOMEDICAL SEARCH. OBJECTIVE: IN A BIOMEDICAL LITERATURE SEARCH, THE LINK BETWEEN A QUERY AND A DOCUMENT IS OFTEN NOT ESTABLISHED, BECAUSE THEY USE DIFFERENT TERMS TO REFER TO THE SAME CONCEPT. DISTRIBUTIONAL WORD EMBEDDINGS ARE FREQUENTLY USED FOR DETECTING RELATED WORDS BY COMPUTING THE COSINE SIMILARITY BETWEEN THEM. HOWEVER, PREVIOUS RESEARCH HAS NOT ESTABLISHED EITHER THE BEST EMBEDDING METHODS FOR DETECTING SYNONYMS AMONG RELATED WORD PAIRS OR HOW EFFECTIVE SUCH METHODS MAY BE. MATERIALS AND METHODS: IN THIS STUDY, WE FIRST CREATE THE BIOSEARCHSYN SET, A MANUALLY ANNOTATED SET OF SYNONYMS, TO ASSESS AND COMPARE 3 WIDELY USED WORD-EMBEDDING METHODS (WORD2VEC, FASTTEXT, AND GLOVE) IN THEIR ABILITY TO DETECT SYNONYMS AMONG RELATED PAIRS OF WORDS. WE DEMONSTRATE THE SHORTCOMINGS OF THE COSINE SIMILARITY SCORE BETWEEN WORD EMBEDDINGS FOR THIS TASK: THE SAME SCORES HAVE VERY DIFFERENT MEANINGS FOR THE DIFFERENT METHODS. TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM, WE PROPOSE UTILIZING POOL ADJACENT VIOLATORS (PAV), AN ISOTONIC REGRESSION ALGORITHM, TO TRANSFORM A COSINE SIMILARITY INTO A PROBABILITY OF 2 WORDS BEING SYNONYMS. RESULTS: EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS USING THE BIOSEARCHSYN SET AS A GOLD STANDARD REVEAL WHICH EMBEDDING METHODS HAVE THE BEST PERFORMANCE IN IDENTIFYING SYNONYM PAIRS. THE BIOSEARCHSYN SET ALSO ALLOWS CONVERTING COSINE SIMILARITY SCORES INTO PROBABILITIES, WHICH PROVIDES A UNIFORM INTERPRETATION OF THE SYNONYMY SCORE OVER DIFFERENT METHODS. CONCLUSIONS: WE INTRODUCED THE BIOSEARCHSYN CORPUS OF 1000 TERM PAIRS, WHICH ALLOWED US TO IDENTIFY THE BEST EMBEDDING METHOD FOR DETECTING SYNONYMY FOR BIOMEDICAL SEARCH. USING THE PROPOSED METHOD, WE CREATED PUBTERMVARIANTS2.0: A LARGE, AUTOMATICALLY EXTRACTED SET OF SYNONYM PAIRS THAT HAVE AUGMENTED PUBMED SEARCHES SINCE THE SPRING OF 2019.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
BEYOND QUERY-ORIENTED HIGHLIGHTING: INVESTIGATING THE EFFECT OF SNIPPET TEXT HIGHLIGHTING IN SEARCH USER BEHAVIOR. SEARCH USERS RELY ON RESULT CAPTIONS INCLUDING TITLES, SNIPPETS, AND URLS TO DECIDE WHETHER THEY SHOULD READ AND CLICK A PARTICULAR RESULT OR NOT. SNIPPET USUALLY SERVES AS A QUERY-DEPENDENT SUMMARY OF ITS CORRESPONDING LANDING PAGE AND IS THEREFORE TREATED AS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTORS IN SEARCH INTERACTION PROCESS. ALTHOUGH THERE EXIST MANY EFFORTS IN IMPROVING SNIPPET GENERATION ALGORITHMS AND INCORPORATING MORE POWERFUL INTERACTION FUNCTIONS INTO SNIPPETS, LITTLE ATTENTION IS PAID TO THE EFFECT OF TEXT HIGHLIGHTING IN USER BEHAVIORS. THE HIGHLIGHTING OF QUERY TERMS IN SEARCH SNIPPETS HAS BEEN REGARDED AS A MATTER OF COURSE AND WHETHER THERE EXISTS A BETTER WAY IN SNIPPET TEXT HIGHLIGHTING REMAINS UNINVESTIGATED. IN THIS PAPER, WE TRY TO FIND OUT WHETHER THE DEFAULT STRATEGY OF HIGHLIGHTING QUERY TERMS EMPLOYED BY MOST COMMERCIAL SEARCH ENGINES IS THE BEST FOR SEARCH USERS. THROUGH CAREFULLY DESIGNED EXPERIMENTS, WE SHOW THAT THE RETRIEVAL EFFICIENCY CAN BE AFFECTED BY DIFFERENT TERM-HIGHLIGHTING STRATEGIES WITHOUT CHANGES IN SNIPPET CONTENTS. WE ALSO PROPOSE AN AUTOMATIC METHOD WHICH ADOPTS CRF TO LEARN TO HIGHLIGHT TERMS BASED ON WORD EMBEDDING, WIKIPEDIA, AND SNIPPET CONTENT INFORMATION. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS SHOW THAT THE PROPOSED METHOD COULD PREDICT HIGHLIGHTED TERMS SELECTED BY CROWD WORKERS WITH MODERATE PERFORMANCE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
BIDIRECTIONAL LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY WITH CRF FOR DETECTING BIOMEDICAL EVENT TRIGGER IN FASTTEXT SEMANTIC SPACE. BACKGROUND: IN BIOMEDICAL INFORMATION EXTRACTION, EVENT EXTRACTION PLAYS A CRUCIAL ROLE. BIOLOGICAL EVENTS ARE USED TO DESCRIBE THE DYNAMIC EFFECTS OR RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN BIOLOGICAL ENTITIES SUCH AS PROTEINS AND GENES. EVENT EXTRACTION IS GENERALLY DIVIDED INTO TRIGGER DETECTION AND ARGUMENT RECOGNITION. THE PERFORMANCE OF TRIGGER DETECTION DIRECTLY AFFECTS THE RESULTS OF THE EVENT EXTRACTION. IN GENERAL, THE TRADITIONAL METHOD IS USED TO ADDRESS THE TRIGGER DETECTION AS A CLASSIFICATION TASK, AS WELL AS THE USE OF MACHINE LEARNING OR RULES METHOD, WHICH CONSTRUCT MANY FEATURES TO IMPROVE THE CLASSIFICATION RESULTS. MOREOVER, THE CLASSIFICATION MODEL ONLY RECOGNIZES TRIGGERS COMPOSED OF SINGLE WORDS, WHEREAS FOR MULTIPLE WORDS, THE RESULT IS UNSATISFACTORY. RESULTS: THE CORPUS OF OUR MODEL IS MLEE. IF WE WERE TO ONLY USE THE BIOMEDICAL LSTM AND CRF MODEL WITHOUT OTHER FEATURES, THE F-SCORE WOULD REACH ABOUT 78.08%. COMPARING ENTITY TO PART OF SPEECH (POS), WE FIND THE ENTITY FEATURES MORE CONDUCIVE TO THE IMPROVEMENT OF PERFORMANCE OF DETECTION, WITH THE F-SCORE POTENTIALLY REACHING ABOUT 80%. FURTHERMORE, WE ALSO EXPERIMENT ON THE OTHER THREE CORPORA (BIONLP 2009, BIONLP 2011, AND BIONLP 2013) TO VERIFY THE GENERALIZATION OF OUR MODEL. HENCE, F-SCORES CAN REACH MORE THAN 60%, WHICH ARE BETTER THAN THE COMPARATIVE EXPERIMENTS. CONCLUSIONS: THE TRIGGER RECOGNITION METHOD BASED ON THE SEQUENCE ANNOTATION MODEL DOES NOT REQUIRE INITIAL COMPLEX FEATURE ENGINEERING, AND ONLY REQUIRES A SIMPLE LABELING MECHANISM TO COMPLETE THE TRAINING. THEREFORE, GENERALIZATION OF OUR MODEL IS BETTER COMPARED TO OTHER TRADITIONAL MODELS. SECONDLY, THIS METHOD CAN IDENTIFY MULTI-WORD TRIGGERS, THEREBY IMPROVING THE F-SCORES OF TRIGGER RECOGNITION. THIRDLY, DETAILS ON THE ENTITY HAVE A CRUCIAL IMPACT ON TRIGGER DETECTION. FINALLY, THE COMBINATION OF CHARACTER-LEVEL WORD EMBEDDING AND WORD-LEVEL WORD EMBEDDING PROVIDES INCREASINGLY EFFECTIVE INFORMATION FOR THE MODEL; THEREFORE, IT IS A KEY TO THE SUCCESS OF THE EXPERIMENT.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
BIOLOGICAL EVENT TRIGGER IDENTIFICATION WITH NOISE CONTRASTIVE ESTIMATION. BIOLOGICAL EVENT EXTRACTION IS AN IMPORTANT TASK TOWARDS THE GOAL OF EXTRACTING BIOMEDICAL KNOWLEDGE FROM THE SCIENTIFIC PUBLICATIONS BY CAPTURING BIOMEDICAL ENTITIES AND THEIR COMPLEX RELATIONS FROM THE TEXTS. AS A CRUCIAL STEP IN EVENT EXTRACTION, EVENT TRIGGER IDENTIFICATION, ASSIGNING WORDS WITH SUITABLE TRIGGER CATEGORY, HAS RECENTLY ATTRACTED SUBSTANTIAL ATTENTION. AS TRIGGERS ARE SCATTERED IN LARGE CORPUS, TRADITIONAL LINGUISTIC PARSERS ARE HARD TO GENERATE SYNTACTIC FEATURES FROM THEM. THEREBY, TRIGGER SPARSITY PROBLEM RESTRICTS THE MODEL'S LEARNING PROCESS AND BECOMES ONE OF THE MAIN HINDER IN TRIGGER IDENTIFICATION. IN THIS PAPER, WE EMPLOY NOISE CONTRASTIVE ESTIMATION WITH MULTI-LAYER PERCEPTRON MODEL FOR SOLVING TRIGGERS' SPARSITY PROBLEM. MEANWHILE, IN THE LIGHT OF RECENT ADVANCE IN WORD DISTRIBUTED REPRESENTATION, WORD-EMBEDDING FEATURE GENERATED BY LANGUAGE MODEL IS UTILIZED FOR SEMANTIC AND SYNTACTIC INFORMATION EXTRACTION. FINALLY, EXPERIMENTAL STUDY ON COMMONLY USED MLEE DATASET AGAINST BASELINE METHODS HAS DEMONSTRATED ITS PROMISING RESULT.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
BIOMEDICAL EVENT TRIGGER DETECTION BY DEPENDENCY-BASED WORD EMBEDDING. BACKGROUND: IN BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH, EVENTS REVEALING COMPLEX RELATIONS BETWEEN ENTITIES PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE. BIOMEDICAL EVENT TRIGGER IDENTIFICATION HAS BECOME A RESEARCH HOTSPOT SINCE ITS IMPORTANT ROLE IN BIOMEDICAL EVENT EXTRACTION. TRADITIONAL MACHINE LEARNING METHODS, SUCH AS SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES (SVM) AND MAXENT CLASSIFIERS, WHICH AIM TO MANUALLY DESIGN POWERFUL FEATURES FED TO THE CLASSIFIERS, DEPEND ON THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE SPECIFIC TASK AND CANNOT GENERALIZE TO THE NEW DOMAIN OR NEW EXAMPLES. METHODS: IN THIS PAPER, WE PROPOSE AN APPROACH WHICH UTILIZES NEURAL NETWORK MODEL BASED ON DEPENDENCY-BASED WORD EMBEDDING TO AUTOMATICALLY LEARN SIGNIFICANT FEATURES FROM RAW INPUT FOR TRIGGER CLASSIFICATION. FIRST, WE EMPLOY WORD2VECF, THE MODIFIED VERSION OF WORD2VEC, TO LEARN WORD EMBEDDING WITH RICH SEMANTIC AND FUNCTIONAL INFORMATION BASED ON DEPENDENCY RELATION TREE. THEN NEURAL NETWORK ARCHITECTURE IS USED TO LEARN MORE SIGNIFICANT FEATURE REPRESENTATION BASED ON RAW DEPENDENCY-BASED WORD EMBEDDING. MEANWHILE, WE DYNAMICALLY ADJUST THE EMBEDDING WHILE TRAINING FOR ADAPTING TO THE TRIGGER CLASSIFICATION TASK. FINALLY, SOFTMAX CLASSIFIER LABELS THE EXAMPLES BY SPECIFIC TRIGGER CLASS USING THE FEATURES LEARNED BY THE MODEL. RESULTS: THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS SHOW THAT OUR APPROACH ACHIEVES A MICRO-AVERAGING F1 SCORE OF 78.27 AND A MACRO-AVERAGING F1 SCORE OF 76.94 % IN SIGNIFICANT TRIGGER CLASSES, AND PERFORMS BETTER THAN BASELINE METHODS. IN ADDITION, WE CAN ACHIEVE THE SEMANTIC DISTRIBUTED REPRESENTATION OF EVERY TRIGGER WORD.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
BIOMEDICAL SEMANTIC INDEXING BY DEEP NEURAL NETWORK WITH MULTI-TASK LEARNING. BACKGROUND: BIOMEDICAL SEMANTIC INDEXING IS IMPORTANT FOR INFORMATION RETRIEVAL AND MANY OTHER RESEARCH FIELDS IN BIOINFORMATICS. IT ANNOTATES BIOMEDICAL CITATIONS WITH MEDICAL SUBJECT HEADINGS. IN FACE OF UNBALANCED CATEGORY DISTRIBUTION IN THE TRAINING DATA, SAMPLING METHODS ARE DIFFICULT TO APPLY FOR SEMANTIC INDEXING TASK. RESULTS: IN THIS PAPER, WE PRESENT A NOVEL DEEP SERIAL MULTI-TASK LEARNING MODEL. THE PRIMARY TASK TREATS THE BIOMEDICAL SEMANTIC INDEXING AS A MULTI-LABEL TEXT CLASSIFICATION ISSUE THAT CONSIDERS THE RELATIONS OF THE LABELS. THE AUXILIARY TASK IS A REGRESSION TASK THAT PREDICTS THE MESH NUMBER OF THE CITATION AND PROVIDES HINTS FOR THE NETWORK TO MAKE IT CONVERGE FASTER. THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS ON THE BIOASQ-TASK5A OPEN DATASET SHOW THAT OUR MODEL OUTPERFORMS THE STATE-OF-THE-ART SOLUTION "MTI", PROPOSED BY THE US NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE. FURTHER, IT NOT ONLY ACHIEVES THE HIGHEST PRECISION AMONG ALL THE SOLUTIONS IN BIOASQ-TASK5A BUT ALSO HAS FASTER CONVERGENCE SPEED COMPARED WITH SOME NAIVE DEEP LEARNING METHODS. CONCLUSIONS: RATHER THAN PARALLEL IN AN ORDINARY MULTI-TASK STRUCTURE, THE TASKS IN OUR MODEL ARE SERIAL AND TIGHTLY COUPLED. IT CAN ACHIEVE SATISFIED PERFORMANCE WITHOUT ANY HANDCRAFTED FEATURE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
BIOVERBNET: A LARGE SEMANTIC-SYNTACTIC CLASSIFICATION OF VERBS IN BIOMEDICINE. BACKGROUND: RECENT ADVANCES IN REPRESENTATION LEARNING HAVE ENABLED LARGE STRIDES IN NATURAL LANGUAGE UNDERSTANDING; HOWEVER, VERBAL REASONING REMAINS A CHALLENGE FOR STATE-OF-THE-ART SYSTEMS. EXTERNAL SOURCES OF STRUCTURED, EXPERT-CURATED VERB-RELATED KNOWLEDGE HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BOOST MODEL PERFORMANCE IN DIFFERENT NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) TASKS WHERE ACCURATE HANDLING OF VERB MEANING AND BEHAVIOUR IS CRITICAL. THE COSTLINESS AND TIME REQUIRED FOR MANUAL LEXICON CONSTRUCTION HAS BEEN A MAJOR OBSTACLE TO PORTING THE BENEFITS OF SUCH RESOURCES TO NLP IN SPECIALISED DOMAINS, SUCH AS BIOMEDICINE. TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE, WE COMBINE A NEURAL CLASSIFICATION METHOD WITH EXPERT ANNOTATION TO CREATE BIOVERBNET. THIS NEW RESOURCE COMPRISES 693 VERBS ASSIGNED TO 22 TOP-LEVEL AND 117 FINE-GRAINED SEMANTIC-SYNTACTIC VERB CLASSES. WE MAKE THIS RESOURCE AVAILABLE COMPLETE WITH SEMANTIC ROLES AND VERBNET-STYLE SYNTACTIC FRAMES. RESULTS: WE DEMONSTRATE THE UTILITY OF THE NEW RESOURCE IN BOOSTING MODEL PERFORMANCE IN DOCUMENT- AND SENTENCE-LEVEL CLASSIFICATION IN BIOMEDICINE. WE APPLY AN ESTABLISHED RETROFITTING METHOD TO HARNESS THE VERB CLASS MEMBERSHIP KNOWLEDGE FROM BIOVERBNET AND TRANSFORM A PRETRAINED WORD EMBEDDING SPACE BY PULLING TOGETHER VERBS BELONGING TO THE SAME SEMANTIC-SYNTACTIC CLASS. THE BIOVERBNET KNOWLEDGE-AWARE EMBEDDINGS SURPASS THE NON-SPECIALISED BASELINE BY A SIGNIFICANT MARGIN ON BOTH TASKS. CONCLUSION: THIS WORK INTRODUCES THE FIRST LARGE, ANNOTATED SEMANTIC-SYNTACTIC CLASSIFICATION OF BIOMEDICAL VERBS, PROVIDING A DETAILED ACCOUNT OF THE ANNOTATION PROCESS, THE KEY DIFFERENCES IN VERB BEHAVIOUR BETWEEN THE GENERAL AND BIOMEDICAL DOMAIN, AND THE DESIGN CHOICES MADE TO ACCURATELY CAPTURE THE MEANING AND PROPERTIES OF VERBS USED IN BIOMEDICAL TEXTS. THE DEMONSTRATED BENEFITS OF LEVERAGING BIOVERBNET IN TEXT CLASSIFICATION SUGGEST THE RESOURCE COULD HELP SYSTEMS BETTER TACKLE CHALLENGING NLP TASKS IN BIOMEDICINE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
BRIDGING CLINICAL AND SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH USING UNSTRUCTURED DATA. THERE IS A GROWING INTEREST IN IDENTIFYING, WEIGHING AND ACCOUNTING FOR THE IMPACT OF HEALTH DETERMINANTS THAT LIE OUTSIDE OF THE TRADITIONAL HEALTHCARE SYSTEM, YET THERE IS A REMARKABLE PAUCITY OF DATA AND SOURCES TO SUSTAIN THESE EFFORTS. DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS WOULD GREATLY BENEFIT FROM LEVERAGING MODELS WHICH ARE ABLE TO EXTEND AND USE SUCH CROSS-DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE. THIS PAPER DESCRIBES AN APPROACH TO IDENTIFY AND EXPLORE RELATED SOCIAL AND CLINICAL TERMS BASED ON LARGE CORPORA OF UNSTRUCTURED DATA. USING WORD EMBEDDING TECHNIQUES ON RELEVANT SOURCES OF KNOWLEDGE, WE HAVE IDENTIFIED TERMS THAT APPEAR CLOSE TOGETHER IN THE HIGH-DIMENSIONAL SPACE. IN PARTICULAR, HAVING CREATED A MODEL WITH CROSS-DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE ON THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH, WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO SURFACE TERMS IN THIS DOMAIN WHEN QUERYING FOR RELATED CLINICAL TERMS, THEREBY CREATING A BRIDGE BETWEEN THE SOCIAL AND CLINICAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. THIS IS A PROMISING APPROACH WITH SIGNIFICANT APPLICABILITY IN DECISION SUPPORT EFFORTS IN HEALTHCARE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
BUILDING AND EVALUATING RESOURCES FOR SENTIMENT ANALYSIS IN THE GREEK LANGUAGE. SENTIMENT LEXICONS AND WORD EMBEDDINGS CONSTITUTE WELL-ESTABLISHED SOURCES OF INFORMATION FOR SENTIMENT ANALYSIS IN ONLINE SOCIAL MEDIA. ALTHOUGH THEIR EFFECTIVENESS HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED IN STATE-OF-THE-ART SENTIMENT ANALYSIS AND RELATED TASKS IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE, SUCH PUBLICLY AVAILABLE RESOURCES ARE MUCH LESS DEVELOPED AND EVALUATED FOR THE GREEK LANGUAGE. IN THIS PAPER, WE TACKLE THE PROBLEMS ARISING WHEN ANALYZING TEXT IN SUCH AN UNDER-RESOURCED LANGUAGE. WE PRESENT AND MAKE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE A RICH SET OF SUCH RESOURCES, RANGING FROM A MANUALLY ANNOTATED LEXICON, TO SEMI-SUPERVISED WORD EMBEDDING VECTORS AND ANNOTATED DATASETS FOR DIFFERENT TASKS. OUR EXPERIMENTS USING DIFFERENT ALGORITHMS AND PARAMETERS ON OUR RESOURCES SHOW PROMISING RESULTS OVER STANDARD BASELINES; ON AVERAGE, WE ACHIEVE A 24.9% RELATIVE IMPROVEMENT IN F-SCORE ON THE CROSS-DOMAIN SENTIMENT ANALYSIS TASK WHEN TRAINING THE SAME ALGORITHMS WITH OUR RESOURCES, COMPARED TO TRAINING THEM ON MORE TRADITIONAL FEATURE SOURCES, SUCH AS N-GRAMS. IMPORTANTLY, WHILE OUR RESOURCES WERE BUILT WITH THE PRIMARY FOCUS ON THE CROSS-DOMAIN SENTIMENT ANALYSIS TASK, THEY ALSO SHOW PROMISING RESULTS IN RELATED TASKS, SUCH AS EMOTION ANALYSIS AND SARCASM DETECTION.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
BUILDING DEEP LEARNING MODELS FOR EVIDENCE CLASSIFICATION FROM THE OPEN ACCESS BIOMEDICAL LITERATURE. WE INVESTIGATE THE APPLICATION OF DEEP LEARNING TO BIOCURATION TASKS THAT INVOLVE CLASSIFICATION OF TEXT ASSOCIATED WITH BIOMEDICAL EVIDENCE IN PRIMARY RESEARCH ARTICLES. WE DEVELOPED A LARGE-SCALE CORPUS OF MOLECULAR PAPERS DERIVED FROM PUBMED AND PUBMED CENTRAL OPEN ACCESS RECORDS AND USED IT TO TRAIN DEEP LEARNING WORD EMBEDDINGS UNDER THE GLOVE, FASTTEXT AND ELMO ALGORITHMS. WE APPLIED THOSE MODELS TO A DISTANT SUPERVISED METHOD CLASSIFICATION TASK BASED ON TEXT FROM FIGURE CAPTIONS OR FRAGMENTS SURROUNDING REFERENCES TO FIGURES IN THE MAIN TEXT USING A VARIETY OR MODELS AND PARAMETERIZATIONS. WE THEN DEVELOPED DOCUMENT CLASSIFICATION (TRIAGE) METHODS FOR MOLECULAR INTERACTION PAPERS BY USING DEEP LEARNING MECHANISMS OF ATTENTION TO AGGREGATE CLASSIFICATION-BASED DECISIONS OVER SELECTED PARAGRAPHS IN THE DOCUMENT. WE WERE ABLE TO OBTAIN TRIAGE PERFORMANCE WITH AN ACCURACY OF 0.82 USING A COMBINED CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK, BI-DIRECTIONAL LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY ARCHITECTURE AUGMENTED BY ATTENTION TO PRODUCE A SINGLE DECISION FOR TRIAGE. IN THIS WORK, WE HOPE TO ENCOURAGE BIOCURATION SYSTEMS DEVELOPERS TO APPLY DEEP LEARNING METHODS TO THEIR SPECIALIZED TASKS BY REPURPOSING LARGE-SCALE WORD EMBEDDING TO APPLY TO THEIR DATA.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
CACP-DEEPGRAM: CLASSIFICATION OF ANTICANCER PEPTIDES VIA DEEP NEURAL NETWORK AND SKIP-GRAM-BASED WORD EMBEDDING MODEL. CANCER IS A TOXIC HEALTH CONCERN WORLDWIDE, IT HAPPENS WHEN CELLULAR MODIFICATIONS CAUSE THE IRREGULAR GROWTH AND DIVISION OF HUMAN CELLS. SEVERAL TRADITIONAL APPROACHES SUCH AS THERAPIES AND WET LABORATORY-BASED METHODS HAVE BEEN APPLIED TO TREAT CANCER CELLS. HOWEVER, THESE METHODS ARE CONSIDERED LESS EFFECTIVE DUE TO THEIR HIGH COST AND DIVERSE SIDE EFFECTS. ACCORDING TO RECENT ADVANCEMENTS, PEPTIDE-BASED THERAPIES HAVE ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION OF SCIENTISTS BECAUSE OF THEIR HIGH SELECTIVITY. PEPTIDE THERAPY CAN EFFICIENTLY TREAT THE TARGETED CELLS, WITHOUT AFFECTING THE NORMAL CELLS. DUE TO THE RAPID INCREASE OF PEPTIDE SEQUENCES, AN ACCURATE PREDICTION MODEL HAS BECOME A CHALLENGING TASK. KEEPING THE SIGNIFICANCE OF ANTICANCER PEPTIDES (ACPS) IN CANCER TREATMENT, AN INTELLIGENT AND RELIABLE PREDICTION MODEL IS HIGHLY INDISPENSABLE. IN THIS PAPER, A FASTTEXT-BASED WORD EMBEDDING STRATEGY HAS BEEN EMPLOYED TO REPRESENT EACH PEPTIDE SAMPLE VIA A SKIP-GRAM MODEL. AFTER EXTRACTING THE PEPTIDE EMBEDDING DESCRIPTORS, THE DEEP NEURAL NETWORK (DNN) MODEL WAS APPLIED TO ACCURATELY DISCRIMINATE THE ACPS. THE OPTIMIZED PARAMETERS OF DNN ACHIEVED AN ACCURACY OF 96.94 %, 93.41 %, AND 94.02 % USING TRAINING, ALTERNATE, AND INDEPENDENT SAMPLES, RESPECTIVELY. IT WAS OBSERVED THAT OUR PROPOSED CACP-DEEPGRAM MODEL OUTPERFORMED AND REPORTED ~10 % HIGHEST PREDICTION ACCURACY THAN EXISTING PREDICTORS. IT IS SUGGESTED THAT THE CACP-DEEPGRAM MODEL WILL BE A RELIABLE TOOL FOR SCIENTISTS AND MIGHT PLAY A VALUABLE ROLE IN ACADEMIC RESEARCH AND DRUG DISCOVERY.

CATEGORY-AWARE CHRONIC STRESS DETECTION ON MICROBLOGS. PEOPLE TODAY LIVE A STRESSFUL LIFE. COMPARED WITH ACUTE STRESS, LONG-TERM CHRONIC STRESS IS MORE HARMFUL, AND MAY CAUSE OR EXACERBATE MANY SERIOUS HEALTH PROBLEMS, INCLUDING HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE, HEART DISEASE, CHRONIC PAIN, AND MENTAL DISEASES. WITH SOCIAL MEDIA BECOMING AN INTEGRAL PART OF OUR DAILY LIVES FOR INFORMATION SHARING AND SELF-EXPRESSION, DETECTING CATEGORY-AWARE LONG-STANDING CHRONIC STRESS FROM A LARGE VOLUME OF HISTORIC OPEN POSTS MADE BY SOCIAL MEDIA USERS IS POSSIBLE. IN THIS STUDY, WE CONSTRUCT A DATA SET CONTAINING 971 CHRONICALLY STRESSED USERS WITH TOTALLY 54 546 OPEN POSTS ON SINA MICROBLOG FROM JULY 5, 2018 TO DECEMBER 1, 2019, AND DESIGN TWO TECHNIQUES FOR CATEGORY-AWARE CHRONIC STRESS DETECTION: (1) A STRESS-ORIENTED WORD EMBEDDING ON THE BASIS OF AN EXISTING PRE-TRAINED WORD EMBEDDING, AIMING TO STRENGTHEN THE SENSIBILITY OF STRESS-RELATED EXPRESSIONS FOR LINGUISTIC POST ANALYSIS; (2) A MULTI-ATTENTION MODEL WITH THREE LAYERS (I.E., CATEGORY-ATTENTION LAYER, POSTS SELF-ATTENTION LAYER, AND CATEGORY-SPECIFIC POST ATTENTION LAYER), AIMING TO CAPTURE INTER-RELEVANCE FROM A SEQUENCE OF POSTS AND INFER LONG-TERM STRESS CATEGORIES AND STRESS LEVELS. THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS SHOW THAT THE PROPOSED MULTI-ATTENTION MODEL EQUIPPED WITH THE STRESS-ORIENTED WORD EMBEDDING CAN ACHIEVE 80.65% ACCURACY IN DETECTING CATEGORY-AWARE STRESS LEVELS, 86.49% ACCURACY IN DETECTING CHRONIC STRESS LEVELS ONLY, AND 93.07% ACCURACY IN DETECTING CHRONIC STRESS CATEGORIES ONLY. LIMITATIONS AND IMPLICATIONS OF THE STUDY ARE ALSO DISCUSSED AT THE END OF THE PAPER.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
CAUSAL RELATIONSHIP EXTRACTION FROM BIOMEDICAL TEXT USING DEEP NEURAL MODELS: A COMPREHENSIVE SURVEY. THE IDENTIFICATION OF CAUSAL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN EVENTS OR ENTITIES WITHIN BIOMEDICAL TEXTS IS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE FOR CREATING SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE BASES AND IS ALSO A FUNDAMENTAL NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) TASK. A CAUSAL (CAUSE-EFFECT) RELATION IS DEFINED AS AN ASSOCIATION BETWEEN TWO EVENTS IN WHICH THE FIRST MUST OCCUR BEFORE THE SECOND. ALTHOUGH THIS TASK IS AN OPEN PROBLEM IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, AND DESPITE ITS IMPORTANT ROLE IN INFORMATION EXTRACTION FROM THE BIOMEDICAL LITERATURE, VERY FEW WORKS HAVE CONSIDERED THIS PROBLEM. HOWEVER, WITH THE ADVENT OF NEW TECHNIQUES IN MACHINE LEARNING, ESPECIALLY DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS, RESEARCH INCREASINGLY ADDRESSES THIS PROBLEM. THIS PAPER SUMMARIZES STATE-OF-THE-ART RESEARCH, ITS APPLICATIONS, EXISTING DATASETS, AND REMAINING CHALLENGES. FOR THIS SURVEY WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED AND EVALUATED VARIOUS TECHNIQUES INCLUDING A MULTIVIEW CNN (MVC), ATTENTION-BASED BILSTM MODELS AND STATE-OF-THE-ART WORD EMBEDDING MODELS, SUCH AS THOSE OBTAINED WITH BIDIRECTIONAL ENCODER REPRESENTATIONS (ELMO) AND TRANSFORMER ARCHITECTURES (BIOBERT). IN ADDITION, WE HAVE EVALUATED A GRAPH LSTM AS WELL AS A BASELINE RULE BASED SYSTEM. WE HAVE INVESTIGATED THE CLASS IMBALANCE PROBLEM AS AN INNATE PROPERTY OF ANNOTATED DATA IN THIS TYPE OF TASK. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT A CONSIDERABLE IMPROVEMENT OF THE RESULTS OF STATE-OF-THE-ART SYSTEMS CAN BE ACHIEVED WHEN A SIMPLE RANDOM OVERSAMPLING TECHNIQUE FOR DATA AUGMENTATION IS USED IN ORDER TO REDUCE CLASS IMBALANCE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
CBGRU: A DETECTION METHOD OF SMART CONTRACT VULNERABILITY BASED ON A HYBRID MODEL. IN THE CONTEXT OF THE RAPID DEVELOPMENT OF BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY, SMART CONTRACTS HAVE ALSO BEEN WIDELY USED IN THE INTERNET OF THINGS, FINANCE, HEALTHCARE, AND OTHER FIELDS. THERE HAS BEEN AN EXPLOSION IN THE NUMBER OF SMART CONTRACTS, AND AT THE SAME TIME, THE SECURITY OF SMART CONTRACTS HAS RECEIVED WIDESPREAD ATTENTION BECAUSE OF THE FINANCIAL LOSSES CAUSED BY SMART CONTRACT VULNERABILITIES. EXISTING ANALYSIS TOOLS CAN DETECT MANY SMART CONTRACT SECURITY VULNERABILITIES, BUT BECAUSE THEY RELY TOO HEAVILY ON HARD RULES DEFINED BY EXPERTS WHEN DETECTING SMART CONTRACT VULNERABILITIES, THE TIME TO PERFORM THE DETECTION INCREASES SIGNIFICANTLY AS THE COMPLEXITY OF THE SMART CONTRACT INCREASES. IN THE PRESENT STUDY, WE PROPOSE A NOVEL HYBRID DEEP LEARNING MODEL NAMED CBGRU THAT STRATEGICALLY COMBINES DIFFERENT WORD EMBEDDING (WORD2VEC, FASTTEXT) WITH DIFFERENT DEEP LEARNING METHODS (LSTM, GRU, BILSTM, CNN, BIGRU). THE MODEL EXTRACTS FEATURES THROUGH DIFFERENT DEEP LEARNING MODELS AND COMBINE THESE FEATURES FOR SMART CONTRACT VULNERABILITY DETECTION. ON THE CURRENTLY PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATASET SMARTBUGS DATASET-WILD, WE DEMONSTRATE THAT THE CBGRU HYBRID MODEL HAS GREAT SMART CONTRACT VULNERABILITY DETECTION PERFORMANCE THROUGH A SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS. BY COMPARING THE PERFORMANCE OF THE PROPOSED MODEL WITH THAT OF PAST STUDIES, THE CBGRU MODEL HAS BETTER SMART CONTRACT VULNERABILITY DETECTION PERFORMANCE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
CHANGE IN THREADS ON TWITTER REGARDING INFLUENZA, VACCINES, AND VACCINATION DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE-BASED INFODEMIOLOGY STUDY. BACKGROUND: DISCUSSIONS OF HEALTH ISSUES ON SOCIAL MEDIA ARE A CRUCIAL INFORMATION SOURCE REFLECTING REAL-WORLD RESPONSES REGARDING EVENTS AND OPINIONS. THEY ARE OFTEN IMPORTANT IN PUBLIC HEALTH CARE, SINCE THESE ARE INFLUENCING PATHWAYS THAT AFFECT VACCINATION DECISION-MAKING BY HESITANT INDIVIDUALS. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE METHODOLOGIES BASED ON INTERNET SEARCH ENGINE QUERIES HAVE BEEN SUGGESTED TO DETECT DISEASE OUTBREAKS AND POPULATION BEHAVIOR. AMONG SOCIAL MEDIA, TWITTER IS A COMMON PLATFORM OF CHOICE TO SEARCH AND SHARE OPINIONS AND (MIS)INFORMATION ABOUT HEALTH CARE ISSUES, INCLUDING VACCINATION AND VACCINES. OBJECTIVE: OUR PRIMARY OBJECTIVE WAS TO SUPPORT THE DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF FUTURE EHEALTH STRATEGIES AND INTERVENTIONS ON SOCIAL MEDIA TO INCREASE THE QUALITY OF TARGETED COMMUNICATION CAMPAIGNS AND THEREFORE INCREASE INFLUENZA VACCINATION RATES. OUR GOAL WAS TO DEFINE AN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE-BASED APPROACH TO ELUCIDATE HOW THREADS IN TWITTER ON INFLUENZA VACCINATION CHANGED DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. SUCH FINDINGS MAY SUPPORT ADAPTED VACCINATION CAMPAIGNS AND COULD BE GENERALIZED TO OTHER HEALTH-RELATED MASS COMMUNICATIONS. METHODS: THE STUDY COMPRISED THE FOLLOWING 5 STAGES: (1) COLLECTING TWEETS FROM TWITTER RELATED TO INFLUENZA, VACCINES, AND VACCINATION IN THE UNITED STATES; (2) DATA CLEANSING AND STORAGE USING MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES; (3) IDENTIFYING TERMS, HASHTAGS, AND TOPICS RELATED TO INFLUENZA, VACCINES, AND VACCINATION; (4) BUILDING A DYNAMIC FOLKSONOMY OF THE PREVIOUSLY DEFINED VOCABULARY (TERMS AND TOPICS) TO SUPPORT THE UNDERSTANDING OF ITS TRENDS; AND (5) LABELING AND EVALUATING THE FOLKSONOMY. RESULTS: WE COLLECTED AND ANALYZED 2,782,720 TWEETS OF 420,617 UNIQUE USERS BETWEEN DECEMBER 30, 2019, AND APRIL 30, 2021. THESE TWEETS WERE IN ENGLISH, WERE FROM THE UNITED STATES, AND INCLUDED AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWING TERMS: "FLU," "INFLUENZA," "VACCINATION," "VACCINE," AND "VAXX." WE NOTICED THAT THE PREVALENCE OF THE TERMS VACCINE AND VACCINATION INCREASED OVER 2020, AND THAT "FLU" AND "COVID" OCCURRENCES WERE INVERSELY CORRELATED AS "FLU" DISAPPEARED OVER TIME FROM THE TWEETS. BY COMBINING WORD EMBEDDING AND CLUSTERING, WE THEN IDENTIFIED A FOLKSONOMY BUILT AROUND THE FOLLOWING 3 TOPICS DOMINATING THE CONTENT OF THE COLLECTED TWEETS: "HEALTH AND MEDICINE (BIOLOGICAL AND CLINICAL ASPECTS)," "PROTECTION AND RESPONSIBILITY," AND "POLITICS." BY ANALYZING TERMS FREQUENTLY APPEARING TOGETHER, WE NOTICED THAT THE TWEETS WERE RELATED MAINLY TO COVID-19 PANDEMIC EVENTS. CONCLUSIONS: THIS STUDY FOCUSED INITIALLY ON VACCINATION AGAINST INFLUENZA AND MOVED TO VACCINATION AGAINST COVID-19. INFOVEILLANCE SUPPORTED BY MACHINE LEARNING ON TWITTER AND OTHER SOCIAL MEDIA ABOUT TOPICS RELATED TO VACCINES AND VACCINATION AGAINST COMMUNICABLE DISEASES AND THEIR TRENDS CAN LEAD TO THE DESIGN OF PERSONALIZED MESSAGES ENCOURAGING TARGETED SUBPOPULATIONS' ENGAGEMENT IN VACCINATION. A GREATER LIKELIHOOD THAT A TARGETED POPULATION RECEIVES A PERSONALIZED MESSAGE IS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER RESPONSE, ENGAGEMENT, AND PROACTIVENESS OF THE TARGET POPULATION FOR THE VACCINATION PROCESS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
CHARACTERIZING WORD EMBEDDINGS FOR ZERO-SHOT SENSOR-BASED HUMAN ACTIVITY RECOGNITION. IN THIS PAPER, WE ADDRESS ZERO-SHOT LEARNING FOR SENSOR ACTIVITY RECOGNITION USING WORD EMBEDDINGS. THE GOAL OF ZERO-SHOT LEARNING IS TO ESTIMATE AN UNKNOWN ACTIVITY CLASS (I.E., AN ACTIVITY THAT DOES NOT EXIST IN A GIVEN TRAINING DATASET) BY LEARNING TO RECOGNIZE COMPONENTS OF ACTIVITIES EXPRESSED IN SEMANTIC VECTORS. THE EXISTING ZERO-SHOT METHODS USE MAINLY 2 KINDS OF REPRESENTATION AS SEMANTIC VECTORS, ATTRIBUTE VECTOR AND EMBEDDING WORD VECTOR. HOWEVER, FEW ZERO-SHOT ACTIVITY RECOGNITION METHODS BASED ON EMBEDDING VECTOR HAVE BEEN STUDIED; ESPECIALLY FOR SENSOR-BASED ACTIVITY RECOGNITION, NO SUCH STUDIES EXIST, TO THE BEST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE. IN THIS PAPER, WE COMPARE AND THOROUGHLY EVALUATE THE ZERO-SHOT METHOD WITH DIFFERENT SEMANTIC VECTORS: (1) ATTRIBUTE VECTOR, (2) EMBEDDING VECTOR, AND (3) EXPANDED EMBEDDING VECTOR AND ANALYZE THEIR CORRELATION TO PERFORMANCE. OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE PERFORMANCE OF THE THREE SPACES IS SIMILAR BUT THE USE OF WORD EMBEDDING LEADS TO A MORE EFFICIENT METHOD, SINCE THIS TYPE OF SEMANTIC VECTOR CAN BE GENERATED AUTOMATICALLY. MOREOVER, OUR SUGGESTED METHOD ACHIEVED HIGHER ACCURACY THAN ATTRIBUTE-VECTOR METHODS, IN CASES WHEN THERE EXIST SIMILAR INFORMATION IN BOTH THE GIVEN SENSOR DATA AND IN THE SEMANTIC VECTOR; THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY HELP SELECT SUITABLE CLASSES AND SENSOR DATA TO BUILD A TRAINING DATASET.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
CHEMICAL NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION IN PATENTS BY DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE AND UNSUPERVISED FEATURE LEARNING. MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY PATENTS CONTAIN RICH INFORMATION ABOUT CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS. ALTHOUGH MUCH EFFORT HAS BEEN DEVOTED TO EXTRACTING CHEMICAL ENTITIES FROM SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE, LIMITED NUMBERS OF PATENT MINING SYSTEMS ARE PUBLICALLY AVAILABLE, PROBABLY DUE TO THE LACK OF LARGE MANUALLY ANNOTATED CORPORA. TO ACCELERATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF INFORMATION EXTRACTION SYSTEMS FOR MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY PATENTS, THE 2015 BIOCREATIVE V CHALLENGE ORGANIZED A TRACK ON CHEMICAL AND DRUG NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION FROM PATENT TEXT (CHEMDNER PATENTS). THIS TRACK INCLUDED THREE INDIVIDUAL SUBTASKS: (I) CHEMICAL ENTITY MENTION RECOGNITION IN PATENTS (CEMP), (II) CHEMICAL PASSAGE DETECTION (CPD) AND (III) GENE AND PROTEIN RELATED OBJECT TASK (GPRO). WE PARTICIPATED IN THE TWO SUBTASKS OF CEMP AND CPD USING MACHINE LEARNING-BASED SYSTEMS. OUR MACHINE LEARNING-BASED SYSTEMS EMPLOYED THE ALGORITHMS OF CONDITIONAL RANDOM FIELDS (CRF) AND STRUCTURED SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES (SSVMS), RESPECTIVELY. TO IMPROVE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE NER SYSTEMS, TWO STRATEGIES WERE PROPOSED FOR FEATURE ENGINEERING: (I) DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE FEATURES OF DICTIONARIES, CHEMICAL STRUCTURAL PATTERNS AND SEMANTIC TYPE INFORMATION PRESENT IN THE CONTEXT OF THE CANDIDATE CHEMICAL AND (II) UNSUPERVISED FEATURE LEARNING ALGORITHMS TO GENERATE WORD REPRESENTATION FEATURES BY BROWN CLUSTERING AND A NOVEL BINARIZED WORD EMBEDDING TO ENHANCE THE GENERALIZABILITY OF THE SYSTEM. FURTHER, THE SYSTEM OUTPUT FOR THE CPD TASK WAS YIELDED BASED ON THE PATENT TITLES AND ABSTRACTS WITH CHEMICALS RECOGNIZED IN THE CEMP TASK.THE EFFECTS OF THE PROPOSED FEATURE STRATEGIES ON BOTH THE MACHINE LEARNING-BASED SYSTEMS WERE INVESTIGATED. OUR BEST SYSTEM ACHIEVED THE SECOND BEST PERFORMANCE AMONG 21 PARTICIPATING TEAMS IN CEMP WITH A PRECISION OF 87.18%, A RECALL OF 90.78% AND AF-MEASURE OF 88.94% AND WAS THE TOP PERFORMING SYSTEM AMONG NINE PARTICIPATING TEAMS IN CPD WITH A SENSITIVITY OF 98.60%, A SPECIFICITY OF 87.21%, AN ACCURACY OF 94.75%, A MATTHEW'S CORRELATION COEFFICIENT (MCC) OF 88.24%, A PRECISION AT FULL RECALL (P_FULL_R) OF 66.57% AND AN AREA UNDER THE PRECISION-RECALL CURVE (AUC_PR) OF 0.9347. THE SSVM-BASED CEMP SYSTEMS OUTPERFORMED THE CRF-BASED CEMP SYSTEMS WHEN USING THE SAME FEATURES. FEATURES GENERATED FROM BOTH THE DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE AND UNSUPERVISED LEARNING ALGORITHMS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED THE CHEMICAL NER TASK ON PATENTS.DATABASE URL:HTTP:// DATABASE. OXFORDJOURNALS.

CHEMICAL-PROTEIN INTERACTION EXTRACTION VIA CONTEXTUALIZED WORD REPRESENTATIONS AND MULTIHEAD ATTENTION. A RICH SOURCE OF CHEMICAL-PROTEIN INTERACTIONS (CPIS) IS LOCKED IN THE EXPONENTIALLY GROWING BIOMEDICAL LITERATURE. AUTOMATIC EXTRACTION OF CPIS IS A CRUCIAL TASK IN BIOMEDICAL NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP), WHICH HAS GREAT BENEFITS FOR PHARMACOLOGICAL AND CLINICAL RESEARCH. DEEP CONTEXT REPRESENTATION AND MULTIHEAD ATTENTION ARE RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN DEEP LEARNING AND HAVE SHOWN THEIR POTENTIAL IN SOME NLP TASKS. UNLIKE TRADITIONAL WORD EMBEDDING, DEEP CONTEXT REPRESENTATION HAS THE ABILITY TO GENERATE COMPREHENSIVE SENTENCE REPRESENTATION BASED ON THE SENTENCE CONTEXT. THE MULTIHEAD ATTENTION MECHANISM CAN EFFECTIVELY LEARN THE IMPORTANT FEATURES FROM DIFFERENT HEADS AND EMPHASIZE THE RELATIVELY IMPORTANT FEATURES. INTEGRATING DEEP CONTEXT REPRESENTATION AND MULTIHEAD ATTENTION WITH A NEURAL NETWORK-BASED MODEL MAY IMPROVE CPI EXTRACTION. WE PRESENT A DEEP NEURAL MODEL FOR CPI EXTRACTION BASED ON DEEP CONTEXT REPRESENTATION AND MULTIHEAD ATTENTION. OUR MODEL MAINLY CONSISTS OF THE FOLLOWING THREE PARTS: A DEEP CONTEXT REPRESENTATION LAYER, A BIDIRECTIONAL LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY NETWORKS (BI-LSTMS) LAYER AND A MULTIHEAD ATTENTION LAYER. THE DEEP CONTEXT REPRESENTATION IS EMPLOYED TO PROVIDE MORE COMPREHENSIVE FEATURE INPUT FOR BI-LSTMS. THE MULTIHEAD ATTENTION CAN EFFECTIVELY EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANT PART OF THE BI-LSTMS OUTPUT. WE EVALUATED OUR METHOD ON THE PUBLIC CHEMPROT CORPUS. THESE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS SHOW THAT BOTH DEEP CONTEXT REPRESENTATION AND MULTIHEAD ATTENTION ARE HELPFUL IN CPI EXTRACTION. OUR METHOD CAN COMPETE WITH OTHER STATE-OF-THE-ART METHODS ON CHEMPROT CORPUS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
CHINESE EMERGENCY EVENT RECOGNITION USING CONV-RDBIGRU MODEL. IN VIEW OF THE WEAK GENERALIZATION OF TRADITIONAL EVENT RECOGNITION METHODS, THE LIMITATION OF DEPENDENCE ON FIELD KNOWLEDGE OF EXPERT, THE LONGER TRAIN TIME OF DEEP NEURAL NETWORK, AND THE PROBLEM OF GRADIENT DISPERSION, THE NEURAL NETWORK JOINT MODEL, CONV-RDBIGRU, INTEGRATED RESIDUAL STRUCTURE WAS PROPOSED. FIRSTLY, TEXT CORPUS IS PREPROCESSED BY WORD SEGMENTATION AND STOP WORDS PROCESSING AND USES WORD EMBEDDING TO FORM THE MATRIX OF WORD VECTORS. THEN, LOCAL SEMANTIC FEATURES ARE EXTRACTED THROUGH CONVOLUTION OPERATION, AND DEEP CONTEXT SEMANTIC FEATURES ARE EXTRACTED THROUGH RDBIGRU. FINALLY, THE LEARNED FEATURES ARE ACTIVATED BY SOFTMAX FUNCTION AND THE RECOGNITION RESULTS ARE OUTPUT. THE NOVELTY OF WORK IS THAT WE INTEGRATE RESIDUAL STRUCTURE INTO RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORK AND COMBINE THESE METHODS AND FIELD OF APPLICATION. THE SIMULATION RESULTS SHOW THAT THIS METHOD IMPROVES PRECISION AND RECALL OF CHINESE EMERGENCY EVENT RECOGNITION, AND THE F-VALUE IS BETTER THAN OTHER METHODS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
CIWGAN AND FIWGAN: ENCODING INFORMATION IN ACOUSTIC DATA TO MODEL LEXICAL LEARNING WITH GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORKS. HOW CAN DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS ENCODE INFORMATION THAT CORRESPONDS TO WORDS IN HUMAN SPEECH INTO RAW ACOUSTIC DATA? THIS PAPER PROPOSES TWO NEURAL NETWORK ARCHITECTURES FOR MODELING UNSUPERVISED LEXICAL LEARNING FROM RAW ACOUSTIC INPUTS: CIWGAN (CATEGORICAL INFOWAVEGAN) AND FIWGAN (FEATURAL INFOWAVEGAN). THESE COMBINE DEEP CONVOLUTIONAL GAN ARCHITECTURE FOR AUDIO DATA (WAVEGAN; DONAHUE ET AL., 2019) WITH THE INFORMATION THEORETIC EXTENSION OF GAN - INFOGAN (CHEN ET AL., 2016) - AND PROPOSE A NEW LATENT SPACE STRUCTURE THAT CAN MODEL FEATURAL LEARNING SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH A HIGHER LEVEL CLASSIFICATION AND ALLOWS FOR A VERY LOW-DIMENSION VECTOR REPRESENTATION OF LEXICAL ITEMS. IN ADDITION TO THE GENERATOR AND DISCRIMINATOR NETWORKS, THE ARCHITECTURES INTRODUCE A NETWORK THAT LEARNS TO RETRIEVE LATENT CODES FROM GENERATED AUDIO OUTPUTS. LEXICAL LEARNING IS THUS MODELED AS EMERGENT FROM AN ARCHITECTURE THAT FORCES A DEEP NEURAL NETWORK TO OUTPUT DATA SUCH THAT UNIQUE INFORMATION IS RETRIEVABLE FROM ITS ACOUSTIC OUTPUTS. THE NETWORKS TRAINED ON LEXICAL ITEMS FROM THE TIMIT CORPUS LEARN TO ENCODE UNIQUE INFORMATION CORRESPONDING TO LEXICAL ITEMS IN THE FORM OF CATEGORICAL VARIABLES IN THEIR LATENT SPACE. BY MANIPULATING THESE VARIABLES, THE NETWORK OUTPUTS SPECIFIC LEXICAL ITEMS. THE NETWORK OCCASIONALLY OUTPUTS INNOVATIVE LEXICAL ITEMS THAT VIOLATE TRAINING DATA, BUT ARE LINGUISTICALLY INTERPRETABLE AND HIGHLY INFORMATIVE FOR COGNITIVE MODELING AND NEURAL NETWORK INTERPRETABILITY. INNOVATIVE OUTPUTS SUGGEST THAT PHONETIC AND PHONOLOGICAL REPRESENTATIONS LEARNED BY THE NETWORK CAN BE PRODUCTIVELY RECOMBINED AND DIRECTLY PARALLELED TO PRODUCTIVITY IN HUMAN SPEECH: A FIWGAN NETWORK TRAINED ON SUIT AND DARK OUTPUTS INNOVATIVE START, EVEN THOUGH IT NEVER SAW START OR EVEN A [ST] SEQUENCE IN THE TRAINING DATA. WE ALSO ARGUE THAT SETTING LATENT FEATURAL CODES TO VALUES WELL BEYOND TRAINING RANGE RESULTS IN ALMOST CATEGORICAL GENERATION OF PROTOTYPICAL LEXICAL ITEMS AND REVEALS UNDERLYING VALUES OF EACH LATENT CODE. PROBING DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS TRAINED ON WELL UNDERSTOOD DEPENDENCIES IN SPEECH BEARS IMPLICATIONS FOR LATENT SPACE INTERPRETABILITY AND UNDERSTANDING HOW DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS LEARN MEANINGFUL REPRESENTATIONS, AS WELL AS POTENTIAL FOR UNSUPERVISED TEXT-TO-SPEECH GENERATION IN THE GAN FRAMEWORK.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
CLASSIFICATION OF PULMONARY NODULAR FINDINGS BASED ON CHARACTERIZATION OF CHANGE USING RADIOLOGY REPORTS. RADIOLOGY REPORTS CONTAIN DESCRIPTIONS OF RADIOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS FOLLOWED BY DIAGNOSIS AND FOLLOW UP RECOMMENDATIONS, TRANSCRIBED BY RADIOLOGISTS WHILE READING MEDICAL IMAGES. ONE OF THE MOST CHALLENGING TASKS IN A RADIOLOGY WORKFLOW IS TO EXTRACT, CHARACTERIZE AND STRUCTURE SUCH CONTENT TO BE ABLE TO PAIR EACH OBSERVATION WITH AN APPROPRIATE ACTION. THIS REQUIRES CLASSIFICATION OF THE FINDINGS BASED ON THE PROVIDED CHARACTERIZATION. IN MOST CLINICAL SETUPS, THIS IS DONE MANUALLY, WHICH IS TEDIOUS, TIME-CONSUMING AND PRONE TO HUMAN ERROR YET OF GREAT IMPORTANCE AS VARIOUS TYPES OF FINDINGS IN THE REPORTS REQUIRE DIFFERENT FOLLOW-UP DECISION SUPPORTS AND DRAW DIFFERENT LEVELS OF ATTENTION. IN THIS WORK, WE PRESENT A FRAMEWORK FOR DETECTION AND CLASSIFICATION OF CHANGE CHARACTERISTICS OF PULMONARY NODULAR FINDINGS IN RADIOLOGY REPORTS. WE COMBINE A PRE-TRAINED WORD EMBEDDING MODEL WITH A DEEP LEARNING BASED SENTENCE ENCODER. TO OVERCOME THE CHALLENGE OF ACCESS TO LIMITED LABELED DATA FOR TRAINING, WE APPLY SIAMESE NETWORK WITH PAIRWISE INPUTS, WHICH ENFORCES THE SIMILARITIES BETWEEN FINDINGS UNDER THE SAME CATEGORY. THE PROPOSED MULTITASK NEURAL NETWORK CLASSIFIER WAS EVALUATED AND COMPARED AGAINST STATE-OF-THE-ART APPROACHES AND DEMONSTRATED PROMISING PERFORMANCE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
CLASSIFYING ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS FROM IMBALANCED TWITTER DATA. BACKGROUND: NOWADAYS, SOCIAL MEDIA ARE OFTEN BEING USED BY GENERAL PUBLIC TO CREATE AND SHARE PUBLIC MESSAGES RELATED TO THEIR HEALTH. WITH THE GLOBAL INCREASE IN SOCIAL MEDIA USAGE, THERE IS A TREND OF POSTING INFORMATION RELATED TO ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS (ADR). MINING THE SOCIAL MEDIA DATA FOR THIS TYPE OF INFORMATION WILL BE HELPFUL FOR PHARMACOLOGICAL POST-MARKETING SURVEILLANCE AND MONITORING. ALTHOUGH THE CONCEPT OF USING SOCIAL MEDIA TO FACILITATE PHARMACOVIGILANCE IS CONVINCING, CONSTRUCTION OF AUTOMATIC ADR DETECTION SYSTEMS REMAINS A CHALLENGE BECAUSE THE CORPORA COMPILED FROM SOCIAL MEDIA TEND TO BE HIGHLY IMBALANCED, POSING A MAJOR OBSTACLE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF CLASSIFIERS WITH RELIABLE PERFORMANCE. METHODS: SEVERAL METHODS HAVE BEEN PROPOSED TO ADDRESS THE CHALLENGE OF IMBALANCED CORPORA. HOWEVER, WE ARE NOT AWARE OF ANY STUDIES THAT INVESTIGATED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE STRATEGIES OF DEALING WITH THE PROBLEM OF IMBALANCED DATA IN THE CONTEXT OF ADR DETECTION FROM SOCIAL MEDIA. IN LIGHT OF THIS, WE EVALUATED A VARIETY OF IMBALANCED TECHNIQUES AND PROPOSED A NOVEL WORD EMBEDDING-BASED SYNTHETIC MINORITY OVER-SAMPLING TECHNIQUE (WESMOTE), WHICH SYNTHESIZES NEW TRAINING EXAMPLES FROM THE SENTENCE REPRESENTATION BASED ON WORD EMBEDDINGS. WE COMPARED THE PERFORMANCE OF ALL METHODS ON TWO LARGE IMBALANCED DATASETS RELEASED FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETECTING ADR POSTS. RESULTS: IN COMPARISON WITH THE STATE-OF-THE-ART APPROACHES, THE CLASSIFIERS THAT INCORPORATED IMBALANCED CLASSIFICATION TECHNIQUES ACHIEVED COMPARABLE OR BETTER F-SCORES. ALL OF OUR BEST PERFORMING CONFIGURATIONS COMBINED RANDOM UNDER-SAMPLING WITH TECHNIQUES INCLUDING THE PROPOSED WESMOTE, BOOSTING AND ENSEMBLE, IMPLYING THAT AN INTEGRATION OF THESE APPROACHES WITH UNDER-SAMPLING PROVIDES A RELIABLE SOLUTION FOR LARGE IMBALANCED SOCIAL MEDIA DATASETS. FURTHERMORE, ENSEMBLE-BASED METHODS LIKE VOTE-BASED UNDER-SAMPLING (VUE) AND RANDOM UNDER-SAMPLING BOOSTING CAN BE ALTERNATIVES FOR THE HYBRID SYNTHETIC METHODS BECAUSE BOTH METHODS INCREASE THE DIVERSITY OF THE CREATED WEAK CLASSIFIERS, LEADING TO BETTER RECALL AND OVERALL F-SCORES FOR THE MINORITY CLASSES. CONCLUSIONS: DATA COLLECTED FROM THE SOCIAL MEDIA ARE USUALLY VERY LARGE AND HIGHLY IMBALANCED. IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE THE PERFORMANCE OF A CLASSIFIER TRAINED ON SUCH DATA, APPLICATIONS OF IMBALANCED STRATEGIES ARE REQUIRED. WE CONSIDERED SEVERAL PRACTICAL METHODS FOR HANDLING IMBALANCED TWITTER DATA ALONG WITH THEIR PERFORMANCE ON THE BINARY CLASSIFICATION TASK WITH RESPECT TO ADRS. IN CONCLUSION, THE FOLLOWING PRACTICAL INSIGHTS ARE GAINED: 1) WHEN DEALING WITH TEXT CLASSIFICATION, THE PROPOSED WORD EMBEDDING-BASED SYNTHETIC MINORITY OVER-SAMPLING TECHNIQUE IS MORE EFFECTIVE THAN TRADITIONAL SYNTHETIC-BASED OVER-SAMPLING METHODS. 2) IN CASES WHERE LARGE AMOUNTS OF TRAINING DATA ARE AVAILABLE, THE IMBALANCED STRATEGIES COMBINED WITH UNDER-SAMPLING TECHNIQUES ARE PREFERRED. 3) FINALLY, EMPLOYMENT OF ADVANCED METHODS DOES NOT GUARANTEE BETTER PERFORMANCE THAN SIMPLER ONES SUCH AS VUE, WHICH ACHIEVED HIGH PERFORMANCE WITH ADVANTAGES LIKE FASTER BUILDING TIME AND EASE OF DEVELOPMENT.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
CLASSIFYING PATIENT PORTAL MESSAGES USING CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS. OBJECTIVE: PATIENTS COMMUNICATE WITH HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS VIA SECURE MESSAGING IN PATIENT PORTALS. AS PATIENT PORTAL ADOPTION INCREASES, GROWING MESSAGING VOLUMES MAY OVERWHELM PROVIDERS. PRIOR RESEARCH HAS DEMONSTRATED PROMISE IN AUTOMATING CLASSIFICATION OF PATIENT PORTAL MESSAGES INTO COMMUNICATION TYPES TO SUPPORT MESSAGE TRIAGE OR ANSWERING. THIS PAPER EXAMINES IF USING SEMANTIC FEATURES AND WORD CONTEXT IMPROVES PORTAL MESSAGE CLASSIFICATION. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PORTAL MESSAGES WERE CLASSIFIED INTO THE FOLLOWING CATEGORIES: INFORMATIONAL, MEDICAL, SOCIAL, AND LOGISTICAL. WE CONSTRUCTED FEATURES FROM PORTAL MESSAGES INCLUDING BAG OF WORDS, BAG OF PHRASES, GRAPH REPRESENTATIONS, AND WORD EMBEDDINGS. WE TRAINED ONE-VERSUS-ALL RANDOM FOREST AND LOGISTIC REGRESSION CLASSIFIERS, AND CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (CNN) WITH A SOFTMAX OUTPUT. WE EVALUATED EACH CLASSIFIER'S PERFORMANCE USING AREA UNDER THE CURVE (AUC). RESULTS: REPRESENTING THE MESSAGES USING BAG OF WORDS, THE RANDOM FOREST DETECTED INFORMATIONAL, MEDICAL, SOCIAL, AND LOGISTICAL COMMUNICATIONS IN PATIENT PORTAL MESSAGES WITH AUCS: 0.803, 0.884, 0.828, AND 0.928, RESPECTIVELY. GRAPH REPRESENTATIONS OF MESSAGES OUTPERFORMED SIMPLER FEATURES WITH AUCS: 0.837, 0.914, 0.846, 0.884 FOR INFORMATIONAL, MEDICAL, SOCIAL, AND LOGISTICAL COMMUNICATION, RESPECTIVELY. REPRESENTING WORDS WITH WORD2VEC EMBEDDINGS, AND MAPPING FEATURES USING A CNN HAD THE BEST PERFORMANCE WITH AUCS: 0.908 FOR INFORMATIONAL, 0.917 FOR MEDICAL, 0.935 FOR SOCIAL, AND 0.943 FOR LOGISTICAL CATEGORIES. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: WORD2VEC AND GRAPH REPRESENTATIONS IMPROVED THE ACCURACY OF CLASSIFYING PORTAL MESSAGES COMPARED TO FEATURES THAT LACKED SEMANTIC INFORMATION SUCH AS BAG OF WORDS, AND BAG OF PHRASES. FURTHERMORE, USING WORD2VEC ALONG WITH A CNN MODEL, WHICH PROVIDE A HIGHER ORDER REPRESENTATION, IMPROVED THE CLASSIFICATION OF PORTAL MESSAGES.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
CLASSIFYING PROMOTERS BY INTERPRETING THE HIDDEN INFORMATION OF DNA SEQUENCES VIA DEEP LEARNING AND COMBINATION OF CONTINUOUS FASTTEXT N-GRAMS. A PROMOTER IS A SHORT REGION OF DNA (100-1,000 BP) WHERE TRANSCRIPTION OF A GENE BY RNA POLYMERASE BEGINS. IT IS TYPICALLY LOCATED DIRECTLY UPSTREAM OR AT THE 5' END OF THE TRANSCRIPTION INITIATION SITE. DNA PROMOTER HAS BEEN PROVEN TO BE THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF MANY HUMAN DISEASES, ESPECIALLY DIABETES, CANCER, OR HUNTINGTON'S DISEASE. THEREFORE, CLASSIFYING PROMOTERS HAS BECOME AN INTERESTING PROBLEM AND IT HAS ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION OF A LOT OF RESEARCHERS IN THE BIOINFORMATICS FIELD. THERE WERE A VARIETY OF STUDIES CONDUCTED TO RESOLVE THIS PROBLEM, HOWEVER, THEIR PERFORMANCE RESULTS STILL REQUIRE FURTHER IMPROVEMENT. IN THIS STUDY, WE WILL PRESENT AN INNOVATIVE APPROACH BY INTERPRETING DNA SEQUENCES AS A COMBINATION OF CONTINUOUS FASTTEXT N-GRAMS, WHICH ARE THEN FED INTO A DEEP NEURAL NETWORK IN ORDER TO CLASSIFY THEM. OUR APPROACH IS ABLE TO ATTAIN A CROSS-VALIDATION ACCURACY OF 85.41 AND 73.1% IN THE TWO LAYERS, RESPECTIVELY. OUR RESULTS OUTPERFORMED THE STATE-OF-THE-ART METHODS ON THE SAME DATASET, ESPECIALLY IN THE SECOND LAYER (STRENGTH CLASSIFICATION). THROUGHOUT THIS STUDY, PROMOTER REGIONS COULD BE IDENTIFIED WITH HIGH ACCURACY AND IT PROVIDES ANALYSIS FOR FURTHER BIOLOGICAL RESEARCH AS WELL AS PRECISION MEDICINE. IN ADDITION, THIS STUDY OPENS NEW PATHS FOR THE NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING APPLICATION IN OMICS DATA IN GENERAL AND DNA SEQUENCES IN PARTICULAR.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
CLASSIFYING RELATIONS IN CLINICAL NARRATIVES USING SEGMENT GRAPH CONVOLUTIONAL AND RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORKS (SEG-GCRNS). WE PROPOSE TO USE SEGMENT GRAPH CONVOLUTIONAL AND RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORKS (SEG-GCRNS), WHICH USE ONLY WORD EMBEDDING AND SENTENCE SYNTACTIC DEPENDENCIES, TO CLASSIFY RELATIONS FROM CLINICAL NOTES WITHOUT MANUAL FEATURE ENGINEERING. IN THIS STUDY, THE RELATIONS BETWEEN 2 MEDICAL CONCEPTS ARE CLASSIFIED BY SIMULTANEOUSLY LEARNING REPRESENTATIONS OF TEXT SEGMENTS IN THE CONTEXT OF SENTENCE SYNTACTIC DEPENDENCY: PRECEDING, CONCEPT1, MIDDLE, CONCEPT2, AND SUCCEEDING SEGMENTS. SEG-GCRN WAS SYSTEMATICALLY EVALUATED ON THE I2B2/VA RELATION CLASSIFICATION CHALLENGE DATASETS. EXPERIMENTS SHOW THAT SEG-GCRN ATTAINS STATE-OF-THE-ART MICRO-AVERAGED F-MEASURE FOR ALL 3 RELATION CATEGORIES: 0.692 FOR CLASSIFYING MEDICAL TREATMENT-PROBLEM RELATIONS, 0.827 FOR MEDICAL TEST-PROBLEM RELATIONS, AND 0.741 FOR MEDICAL PROBLEM-MEDICAL PROBLEM RELATIONS. COMPARISON WITH THE PREVIOUS STATE-OF-THE-ART SEGMENT CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (SEG-CNN) SUGGESTS THAT ADDING SYNTACTIC DEPENDENCY INFORMATION HELPS REFINE MEDICAL WORD EMBEDDING AND IMPROVES CONCEPT RELATION CLASSIFICATION WITHOUT MANUAL FEATURE ENGINEERING. SEG-GCRN CAN BE TRAINED EFFICIENTLY FOR THE I2B2/VA DATASET ON A GPU PLATFORM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
CLINICAL APPLICATION OF EARLY WARNING SCORING BASED ON BILSTM-ATTENTION IN EMERGENCY OBSTETRIC PREEXAMINATION AND TRIAGE. MATERNITY IS A SPECIAL CATEGORY OF POPULATION AND THE CRITERIA FOR EMERGENCY PRESCREENING CANNOT BE DIRECTLY APPLIED TO ADULTS. THEREFORE, A SET OF CRITERIA FOR GRADING MATERNAL CONDITIONS SHOULD BE ESTABLISHED. IN THIS PAPER, WE HAVE COMBINED THE SEMANTIC ANALYSIS TECHNIQUE OF BILSTM-ATTENTION NEURAL NETWORK AND FUZZY DEFECT RISK ASSESSMENT METHOD, TO DEVELOP A HYBRID APPROACH, TO PREPROCESS THE TEXT OF EMERGENCY OBSTETRIC PRESCREENING INFORMATION. FURTHERMORE, WE HAVE USED WORD2VEC TO CHARACTERIZE THE WORD EMBEDDING VECTOR AND HIGHLIGHT THE FEATURES RELATED TO THE DEGREE OF DEFECTS OF EMERGENCY OBSTETRIC PRESCREENING INFORMATION THROUGH THE ATTENTION MECHANISM AND OBTAIN THE SEMANTIC FEATURE VECTOR OF THE WARNING INFORMATION. BILSTM-ATTENTION NEURAL NETWORK HAS THE DUAL ADVANTAGES OF EXTRACTING BIDIRECTIONAL SEMANTIC INFORMATION AND GIVING WEIGHT TO IMPORTANT JUDGMENT INFORMATION WHICH HAS EFFECTIVELY IMPROVED THE SEMANTIC UNDERSTANDING ACCURACY. EXPERIMENTAL TESTS AND APPLICATION ANALYSIS SHOW THAT THE JUDGMENT MODEL WHICH IS BASED ON PROPOSED METHOD HAS ACCURATELY CLASSIFIED AND GRADED THE DEFECTS OF EMERGENCY OBSTETRIC PRESCREENING ALERTS. ADDITIONALLY, THE ACCURACY AND MICROAVERAGE VALUE ARE USED AS EVALUATION INDEXES.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
CLINICAL CONTEXT-AWARE BIOMEDICAL TEXT SUMMARIZATION USING DEEP NEURAL NETWORK: MODEL DEVELOPMENT AND VALIDATION. BACKGROUND: AUTOMATIC TEXT SUMMARIZATION (ATS) ENABLES USERS TO RETRIEVE MEANINGFUL EVIDENCE FROM BIG DATA OF BIOMEDICAL REPOSITORIES TO MAKE COMPLEX CLINICAL DECISIONS. DEEP NEURAL AND RECURRENT NETWORKS OUTPERFORM TRADITIONAL MACHINE-LEARNING TECHNIQUES IN AREAS OF NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING AND COMPUTER VISION; HOWEVER, THEY ARE YET TO BE EXPLORED IN THE ATS DOMAIN, PARTICULARLY FOR MEDICAL TEXT SUMMARIZATION. OBJECTIVE: TRADITIONAL APPROACHES IN ATS FOR BIOMEDICAL TEXT SUFFER FROM FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES SUCH AS AN INABILITY TO CAPTURE CLINICAL CONTEXT, QUALITY OF EVIDENCE, AND PURPOSE-DRIVEN SELECTION OF PASSAGES FOR THE SUMMARY. WE AIMED TO CIRCUMVENT THESE LIMITATIONS THROUGH ACHIEVING PRECISE, SUCCINCT, AND COHERENT INFORMATION EXTRACTION FROM CREDIBLE PUBLISHED BIOMEDICAL RESOURCES, AND TO CONSTRUCT A SIMPLIFIED SUMMARY CONTAINING THE MOST INFORMATIVE CONTENT THAT CAN OFFER A REVIEW PARTICULAR TO CLINICAL NEEDS. METHODS: IN OUR PROPOSED APPROACH, WE INTRODUCE A NOVEL FRAMEWORK, TERMED BIOMED-SUMMARIZER, THAT PROVIDES QUALITY-AWARE PATIENT/PROBLEM, INTERVENTION, COMPARISON, AND OUTCOME (PICO)-BASED INTELLIGENT AND CONTEXT-ENABLED SUMMARIZATION OF BIOMEDICAL TEXT. BIOMED-SUMMARIZER INTEGRATES THE PROGNOSIS QUALITY RECOGNITION MODEL WITH A CLINICAL CONTEXT-AWARE MODEL TO LOCATE TEXT SEQUENCES IN THE BODY OF A BIOMEDICAL ARTICLE FOR USE IN THE FINAL SUMMARY. FIRST, WE DEVELOPED A DEEP NEURAL NETWORK BINARY CLASSIFIER FOR QUALITY RECOGNITION TO ACQUIRE SCIENTIFICALLY SOUND STUDIES AND FILTER OUT OTHERS. SECOND, WE DEVELOPED A BIDIRECTIONAL LONG-SHORT TERM MEMORY RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORK AS A CLINICAL CONTEXT-AWARE CLASSIFIER, WHICH WAS TRAINED ON SEMANTICALLY ENRICHED FEATURES GENERATED USING A WORD-EMBEDDING TOKENIZER FOR IDENTIFICATION OF MEANINGFUL SENTENCES REPRESENTING PICO TEXT SEQUENCES. THIRD, WE CALCULATED THE SIMILARITY BETWEEN QUERY AND PICO TEXT SEQUENCES USING JACCARD SIMILARITY WITH SEMANTIC ENRICHMENTS, WHERE THE SEMANTIC ENRICHMENTS ARE OBTAINED USING MEDICAL ONTOLOGIES. LAST, WE GENERATED A REPRESENTATIVE SUMMARY FROM THE HIGH-SCORING PICO SEQUENCES AGGREGATED BY STUDY TYPE, PUBLICATION CREDIBILITY, AND FRESHNESS SCORE. RESULTS: EVALUATION OF THE PROGNOSIS QUALITY RECOGNITION MODEL USING A LARGE DATASET OF BIOMEDICAL LITERATURE RELATED TO INTRACRANIAL ANEURYSM SHOWED AN ACCURACY OF 95.41% (2562/2686) IN TERMS OF RECOGNIZING QUALITY ARTICLES. THE CLINICAL CONTEXT-AWARE MULTICLASS CLASSIFIER OUTPERFORMED THE TRADITIONAL MACHINE-LEARNING ALGORITHMS, INCLUDING SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE, GRADIENT BOOSTED TREE, LINEAR REGRESSION, K-NEAREST NEIGHBOR, AND NAIVE BAYES, BY ACHIEVING 93% (16127/17341) ACCURACY FOR CLASSIFYING FIVE CATEGORIES: AIM, POPULATION, INTERVENTION, RESULTS, AND OUTCOME. THE SEMANTIC SIMILARITY ALGORITHM ACHIEVED A SIGNIFICANT PEARSON CORRELATION COEFFICIENT OF 0.61 (0-1 SCALE) ON A WELL-KNOWN BIOSSES DATASET (WITH 100 PAIR SENTENCES) AFTER SEMANTIC ENRICHMENT, REPRESENTING AN IMPROVEMENT OF 8.9% OVER BASELINE JACCARD SIMILARITY. FINALLY, WE FOUND A HIGHLY POSITIVE CORRELATION AMONG THE EVALUATIONS PERFORMED BY THREE DOMAIN EXPERTS CONCERNING DIFFERENT METRICS, SUGGESTING THAT THE AUTOMATED SUMMARIZATION IS SATISFACTORY. CONCLUSIONS: BY EMPLOYING THE PROPOSED METHOD BIOMED-SUMMARIZER, HIGH ACCURACY IN ATS WAS ACHIEVED, ENABLING SEAMLESS CURATION OF RESEARCH EVIDENCE FROM THE BIOMEDICAL LITERATURE TO USE FOR CLINICAL DECISION-MAKING.
CLINICAL NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION FROM CHINESE ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS BASED ON DEEP LEARNING PRETRAINING. BACKGROUND: CLINICAL NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION IS THE BASIC TASK OF MINING ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS TEXT, WHICH ARE WITH SOME CHALLENGES CONTAINING THE LANGUAGE FEATURES OF CHINESE ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS TEXT WITH MANY COMPOUND ENTITIES, SERIOUS MISSING SENTENCE COMPONENTS, AND UNCLEAR ENTITY BOUNDARY. MOREOVER, THE CORPUS OF CHINESE ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS IS DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN. METHODS: AIMING AT THESE CHARACTERISTICS OF CHINESE ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS, THIS STUDY PROPOSED A CHINESE CLINICAL ENTITY RECOGNITION MODEL BASED ON DEEP LEARNING PRETRAINING. THE MODEL USED WORD EMBEDDING FROM DOMAIN CORPUS AND FINE-TUNING OF ENTITY RECOGNITION MODEL PRETRAINED BY RELEVANT CORPUS. THEN BILSTM AND TRANSFORMER ARE, RESPECTIVELY, USED AS FEATURE EXTRACTORS TO IDENTIFY FOUR TYPES OF CLINICAL ENTITIES INCLUDING DISEASES, SYMPTOMS, DRUGS, AND OPERATIONS FROM THE TEXT OF CHINESE ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS. RESULTS: 75.06% MACRO-P, 76.40% MACRO-R, AND 75.72% MACRO-F1 AIMING AT TEST DATASET COULD BE ACHIEVED. THESE EXPERIMENTS SHOW THAT THE CHINESE CLINICAL ENTITY RECOGNITION MODEL BASED ON DEEP LEARNING PRETRAINING CAN EFFECTIVELY IMPROVE THE RECOGNITION EFFECT. CONCLUSIONS: THESE EXPERIMENTS SHOW THAT THE PROPOSED CHINESE CLINICAL ENTITY RECOGNITION MODEL BASED ON DEEP LEARNING PRETRAINING CAN EFFECTIVELY IMPROVE THE RECOGNITION PERFORMANCE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
COAID-DEEP: AN OPTIMIZED INTELLIGENT FRAMEWORK FOR AUTOMATED DETECTING COVID-19 MISLEADING INFORMATION ON TWITTER. COVID-19 HAS AFFECTED ALL PEOPLES' LIVES. THOUGH COVID-19 IS ON THE RISING, THE EXISTENCE OF MISINFORMATION ABOUT THE VIRUS ALSO GROWS IN PARALLEL. ADDITIONALLY, THE SPREAD OF MISINFORMATION HAS CREATED CONFUSION AMONG PEOPLE, CAUSED DISTURBANCES IN SOCIETY, AND EVEN LED TO DEATHS. SOCIAL MEDIA IS CENTRAL TO OUR DAILY LIVES. THE INTERNET HAS BECOME A SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF KNOWLEDGE. OWING TO THE WIDESPREAD DAMAGE CAUSED BY FAKE NEWS, IT IS IMPORTANT TO BUILD COMPUTERIZED SYSTEMS TO DETECT FAKE NEWS. THE PAPER PROPOSES AN UPDATED DEEP NEURAL NETWORK FOR IDENTIFICATION OF FALSE NEWS. THE DEEP LEARNING TECHNIQUES ARE THE MODIFIED-LSTM (ONE TO THREE LAYERS) AND THE MODIFIED GRU (ONE TO THREE LAYERS). IN PARTICULAR, WE CARRY OUT INVESTIGATIONS OF A LARGE DATASET OF TWEETS PASSING ON DATA WITH RESPECT TO COVID-19. IN OUR STUDY, WE SEPARATE THE DUBIOUS CLAIMS INTO TWO CATEGORIES: TRUE AND FALSE. WE COMPARE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE VARIOUS ALGORITHMS IN TERMS OF PREDICTION ACCURACY. THE SIX MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES ARE DECISION TREES, LOGISTIC REGRESSION, K NEAREST NEIGHBORS, RANDOM FORESTS, SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES, AND NAIVE BAYES (NB). THE PARAMETERS OF DEEP LEARNING TECHNIQUES ARE OPTIMIZED USING KERAS-TUNER. FOUR BENCHMARK DATASETS WERE USED. TWO FEATURE EXTRACTION METHODS WERE USED (TF-ID WITH N-GRAM) TO EXTRACT ESSENTIAL FEATURES FROM THE FOUR BENCHMARK DATASETS FOR THE BASELINE MACHINE LEARNING MODEL AND WORD EMBEDDING FEATURE EXTRACTION METHOD FOR THE PROPOSED DEEP NEURAL NETWORK METHODS. THE RESULTS OBTAINED WITH THE PROPOSED FRAMEWORK REVEAL HIGH ACCURACY IN DETECTING FAKE AND NON-FAKE TWEETS CONTAINING COVID-19 INFORMATION. THESE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT AS COMPARED TO THE EXISTING STATE OF ART RESULTS OF BASELINE MACHINE LEARNING MODELS. IN OUR APPROACH, WE CLASSIFY THE DATA INTO TWO CATEGORIES: FAKE OR NONFAKE. WE COMPARE THE EXECUTION OF THE PROPOSED APPROACHES WITH SIX MACHINE LEARNING PROCEDURES. THE SIX MACHINE LEARNING PROCEDURES ARE DECISION TREE (DT), LOGISTIC REGRESSION (LR), K NEAREST NEIGHBOR (KNN), RANDOM FOREST (RF), SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE (SVM), AND NAIVE BAYES (NB). THE PARAMETERS OF DEEP LEARNING TECHNIQUES ARE OPTIMIZED USING KERAS-TUNER. FOUR BENCHMARK DATASETS WERE USED. TWO FEATURE EXTRACTION METHODS WERE USED (TF-ID WITH N-GRAM) TO EXTRACT ESSENTIAL FEATURES FROM THE FOUR BENCHMARK DATASETS FOR THE BASELINE MACHINE LEARNING MODEL AND WORD EMBEDDING FEATURE EXTRACTION METHOD FOR THE PROPOSED DEEP NEURAL NETWORK METHODS. THE RESULTS OBTAINED WITH THE PROPOSED FRAMEWORK REVEAL HIGH ACCURACY IN DETECTING FAKE AND NON-FAKE TWEETS CONTAINING COVID-19 INFORMATION. THESE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT AS COMPARED TO THE EXISTING STATE OF ART RESULTS OF BASELINE MACHINE LEARNING MODELS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
COMBINE FACTUAL MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE AND DISTRIBUTED WORD REPRESENTATION TO IMPROVE CLINICAL NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION. THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASING INTEREST IN DEVELOPING DEEP LEARNING METHODS TO RECOGNIZE CLINICAL CONCEPTS FROM NARRATIVE CLINICAL TEXT. RECENTLY, SEVERAL STUDIES HAVE REPORTED THAT RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORKS (RNNS) OUTPERFORMED TRADITIONAL MACHINE LEARNING METHODS SUCH AS CONDITIONAL RANDOM FIELDS (CRFS). DEEP LEARNING-BASED NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION (NER) SYSTEMS OFTEN USE STATISTICAL LANGUAGE MODELS TO LEARN WORD EMBEDDINGS FROM UNLABELED CORPORA. HOWEVER, CURRENT WORD EMBEDDING METHODS HAVE LIMITATIONS TO LEARN DECENT REPRESENTATIONS FOR LOW-FREQUENCY WORDS. MEDICINE IS A KNOWLEDGE-EXTENSIVE DOMAIN; EXISTING MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE HAS THE POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE FEATURE REPRESENTATIONS FOR LESS FREQUENT YET IMPORTANT WORDS. HOWEVER, IT IS STILL NOT CLEAR HOW EXISTING MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE CAN HELP DEEP LEARNING MODELS IN CLINICAL NER TASKS. IN THIS STUDY, WE INTEGRATED MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE FROM THE UNIFIED MEDICAL LANGUAGE SYSTEM WITH WORD EMBEDDINGS TRAINED FROM AN UNLABELED CLINICAL CORPUS IN RNNS FOR DETECTION OF PROBLEMS, TREATMENTS AND LAB TESTS. WE EXAMINED THREE DIFFERENT WAYS TO GENERATE MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE FEATURES, INCLUDING A DICTIONARY LOOKUP PROGRAM, THE KNOWLEDGEMAP SYSTEM, AND THE MEDLEE SYSTEM. WE ALSO COMPARED REPRESENTING MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE AS ONE-HOT VECTORS VERSUS REPRESENTING MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE AS EMBEDDING LAYERS. THE EVALUATION RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE RNN WITH MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE AS EMBEDDING LAYERS ACHIEVED NEW STATE-OF-THE-ART PERFORMANCE (A STRICT F1 SCORE OF 86.21% AND A RELAXED F1 SCORE OF 92.80%) ON THE 2010 I2B2 CORPUS, OUTPERFORMING AN RNN WITH ONLY WORD EMBEDDINGS AND RNNS WITH MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE AS ONE-HOT VECTORS. THIS STUDY DEMONSTRATED AN EFFICIENT WAY OF INTEGRATING MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE WITH DISTRIBUTED WORD REPRESENTATIONS FOR CLINICAL NER.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
COMBINING CONTEXTUALIZED EMBEDDINGS AND PRIOR KNOWLEDGE FOR CLINICAL NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION: EVALUATION STUDY. BACKGROUND: NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION (NER) IS A KEY STEP IN CLINICAL NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP). TRADITIONALLY, RULE-BASED SYSTEMS LEVERAGE PRIOR KNOWLEDGE TO DEFINE RULES TO IDENTIFY NAMED ENTITIES. RECENTLY, DEEP LEARNING-BASED NER SYSTEMS HAVE BECOME MORE AND MORE POPULAR. CONTEXTUALIZED WORD EMBEDDING, AS A NEW TYPE OF REPRESENTATION OF THE WORD, HAS BEEN PROPOSED TO DYNAMICALLY CAPTURE WORD SENSE USING CONTEXT INFORMATION AND HAS PROVEN SUCCESSFUL IN MANY DEEP LEARNING-BASED SYSTEMS IN EITHER GENERAL DOMAIN OR MEDICAL DOMAIN. HOWEVER, THERE ARE VERY FEW STUDIES THAT INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF COMBINING MULTIPLE CONTEXTUALIZED EMBEDDINGS AND PRIOR KNOWLEDGE ON THE CLINICAL NER TASK. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY AIMS TO IMPROVE THE PERFORMANCE OF NER IN CLINICAL TEXT BY COMBINING MULTIPLE CONTEXTUAL EMBEDDINGS AND PRIOR KNOWLEDGE. METHODS: IN THIS STUDY, WE INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF COMBINING MULTIPLE CONTEXTUALIZED WORD EMBEDDINGS WITH CLASSIC WORD EMBEDDING IN DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS TO PREDICT NAMED ENTITIES IN CLINICAL TEXT. WE ALSO INVESTIGATE WHETHER USING A SEMANTIC LEXICON COULD FURTHER IMPROVE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE CLINICAL NER SYSTEM. RESULTS: BY COMBINING CONTEXTUALIZED EMBEDDINGS SUCH AS ELMO AND FLAIR, OUR SYSTEM ACHIEVES THE F-1 SCORE OF 87.30% WHEN ONLY TRAINING BASED ON A PORTION OF THE 2010 INFORMATICS FOR INTEGRATING BIOLOGY AND THE BEDSIDE NER TASK DATASET. AFTER INCORPORATING THE MEDICAL LEXICON INTO THE WORD EMBEDDING, THE F-1 SCORE WAS FURTHER INCREASED TO 87.44%. ANOTHER FINDING WAS THAT OUR SYSTEM STILL COULD ACHIEVE AN F-1 SCORE OF 85.36% WHEN THE SIZE OF THE TRAINING DATA WAS REDUCED TO 40%. CONCLUSIONS: COMBINED CONTEXTUALIZED EMBEDDING COULD BE BENEFICIAL FOR THE CLINICAL NER TASK. MOREOVER, THE SEMANTIC LEXICON COULD BE USED TO FURTHER IMPROVE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE CLINICAL NER SYSTEM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS ON FACEBOOK POST INTERACTION USING DNN, ELM AND LSTM. THIS STUDY PRESENTS A NOVEL RESEARCH APPROACH TO PREDICT USER INTERACTION FOR SOCIAL MEDIA POST USING MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS. THE POSTS ARE CONVERTED TO VECTOR FORM USING WORD2VEC AND DOC2VEC MODEL. THESE TWO METHODS ARE USED TO ANALYSE THE BEST APPROACH FOR GENERATING WORD EMBEDDINGS. THE GENERATED WORD EMBEDDINGS OF POST COMBINED WITH OTHER ATTRIBUTES LIKE POST PUBLISHED TIME, TYPE OF POST AND TOTAL INTERACTIONS ARE USED TO TRAIN MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS. DEEP NEURAL NETWORK (DNN), EXTREME LEARNING MACHINE (ELM) AND LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY (LSTM) ARE USED TO COMPARE THE PREDICTION OF TOTAL INTERACTION FOR A PARTICULAR POST. FOR WORD2VEC, THE WORD VECTORS ARE CREATED USING BOTH CONTINUOUS BAG-OF-WORDS (CBOW) AND SKIP-GRAM MODELS. ALSO THE PRE-TRAINED WORD VECTORS PROVIDED BY GOOGLE IS USED FOR THE ANALYSIS. FOR DOC2VEC, THE WORD EMBEDDINGS ARE CREATED USING BOTH THE DISTRIBUTED MEMORY MODEL OF PARAGRAPH VECTORS (PV-DM) AND DISTRIBUTED BAG OF WORDS MODEL OF PARAGRAPH VECTORS (PV-DBOW). A WORD EMBEDDING IS ALSO CREATED USING PV-DBOW COMBINED WITH SKIP-GRAM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
COMPARING DEEP LEARNING ARCHITECTURES FOR SENTIMENT ANALYSIS ON DRUG REVIEWS. SINCE THE TURN OF THE CENTURY, AS MILLIONS OF USER'S OPINIONS ARE AVAILABLE ON THE WEB, SENTIMENT ANALYSIS HAS BECOME ONE OF THE MOST FRUITFUL RESEARCH FIELDS IN NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP). RESEARCH ON SENTIMENT ANALYSIS HAS COVERED A WIDE RANGE OF DOMAINS SUCH AS ECONOMY, POLITY, AND MEDICINE, AMONG OTHERS. IN THE PHARMACEUTICAL FIELD, AUTOMATIC ANALYSIS OF ONLINE USER REVIEWS ALLOWS FOR THE ANALYSIS OF LARGE AMOUNTS OF USER'S OPINIONS AND TO OBTAIN RELEVANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE EFFECTIVENESS AND SIDE EFFECTS OF DRUGS, WHICH COULD BE USED TO IMPROVE PHARMACOVIGILANCE SYSTEMS. THROUGHOUT THE YEARS, APPROACHES FOR SENTIMENT ANALYSIS HAVE PROGRESSED FROM SIMPLE RULES TO ADVANCED MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES SUCH AS DEEP LEARNING, WHICH HAS BECOME AN EMERGING TECHNOLOGY IN MANY NLP TASKS. SENTIMENT ANALYSIS IS NOT OBLIVIOUS TO THIS SUCCESS, AND SEVERAL SYSTEMS BASED ON DEEP LEARNING HAVE RECENTLY DEMONSTRATED THEIR SUPERIORITY OVER FORMER METHODS, ACHIEVING STATE-OF-THE-ART RESULTS ON STANDARD SENTIMENT ANALYSIS DATASETS. HOWEVER, PRIOR WORK SHOWS THAT VERY FEW ATTEMPTS HAVE BEEN MADE TO APPLY DEEP LEARNING TO SENTIMENT ANALYSIS OF DRUG REVIEWS. WE PRESENT A BENCHMARK COMPARISON OF VARIOUS DEEP LEARNING ARCHITECTURES SUCH AS CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS (CNN) AND LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY (LSTM) RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORKS. WE PROPOSE SEVERAL COMBINATIONS OF THESE MODELS AND ALSO STUDY THE EFFECT OF DIFFERENT PRE-TRAINED WORD EMBEDDING MODELS. AS TRANSFORMERS HAVE REVOLUTIONIZED THE NLP FIELD ACHIEVING STATE-OF-ART RESULTS FOR MANY NLP TASKS, WE ALSO EXPLORE BIDIRECTIONAL ENCODER REPRESENTATIONS FROM TRANSFORMERS (BERT) WITH A BI-LSTM FOR THE SENTIMENT ANALYSIS OF DRUG REVIEWS. OUR EXPERIMENTS SHOW THAT THE USAGE OF BERT OBTAINS THE BEST RESULTS, BUT WITH A VERY HIGH TRAINING TIME. ON THE OTHER HAND, CNN ACHIEVES ACCEPTABLE RESULTS WHILE REQUIRING LESS TRAINING TIME.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
COMPARING GENERAL AND SPECIALIZED WORD EMBEDDINGS FOR BIOMEDICAL NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION. INCREASED INTEREST IN THE USE OF WORD EMBEDDINGS, SUCH AS WORD REPRESENTATION, FOR BIOMEDICAL NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION (BIONER) HAS HIGHLIGHTED THE NEED FOR EVALUATIONS THAT AID IN SELECTING THE BEST WORD EMBEDDING TO BE USED. ONE COMMON CRITERION FOR SELECTING A WORD EMBEDDING IS THE TYPE OF SOURCE FROM WHICH IT IS GENERATED; THAT IS, GENERAL (E.G., WIKIPEDIA, COMMON CRAWL), OR SPECIFIC (E.G., BIOMEDICAL LITERATURE). USING SPECIFIC WORD EMBEDDINGS FOR THE BIONER TASK HAS BEEN STRONGLY RECOMMENDED, CONSIDERING THAT THEY HAVE PROVIDED BETTER COVERAGE AND SEMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS AMONG MEDICAL ENTITIES. TO THE BEST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE, MOST STUDIES HAVE FOCUSED ON IMPROVING BIONER TASK PERFORMANCE BY, ON THE ONE HAND, COMBINING SEVERAL FEATURES EXTRACTED FROM THE TEXT (FOR INSTANCE, LINGUISTIC, MORPHOLOGICAL, CHARACTER EMBEDDING, AND WORD EMBEDDING ITSELF) AND, ON THE OTHER, TESTING SEVERAL STATE-OF-THE-ART NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION ALGORITHMS. THE LATTER, HOWEVER, DO NOT PAY GREAT ATTENTION TO THE INFLUENCE OF THE WORD EMBEDDINGS, AND DO NOT FACILITATE OBSERVING THEIR REAL IMPACT ON THE BIONER TASK. FOR THIS REASON, THE PRESENT STUDY EVALUATES THREE WELL-KNOWN NER ALGORITHMS (CRF, BILSTM, BILSTM-CRF) WITH RESPECT TO TWO CORPORA (DRUGBANK AND MEDLINE) USING TWO CLASSIC WORD EMBEDDINGS, GLOVE COMMON CRAWL (OF THE GENERAL TYPE) AND PYYSALO PM + PMC (SPECIFIC), AS UNIQUE FEATURES. FURTHERMORE, THREE CONTEXTUALIZED WORD EMBEDDINGS (ELMO, POOLED FLAIR, AND TRANSFORMER) ARE COMPARED IN THEIR GENERAL AND SPECIFIC VERSIONS. THE AIM IS TO DETERMINE WHETHER GENERAL EMBEDDINGS CAN PERFORM BETTER THAN SPECIALIZED ONES ON THE BIONER TASK. TO THIS END, FOUR EXPERIMENTS WERE DESIGNED. IN THE FIRST, WE SET OUT TO IDENTIFY THE COMBINATION OF CLASSIC WORD EMBEDDING, NER ALGORITHM, AND CORPUS THAT RESULTS IN THE BEST PERFORMANCE. THE SECOND EVALUATED THE EFFECT OF THE SIZE OF THE CORPUS ON PERFORMANCE. THE THIRD ASSESSED THE SEMANTIC COHESIVENESS OF THE CLASSIC WORD EMBEDDINGS AND THEIR CORRELATION WITH RESPECT TO SEVERAL GOLD STANDARDS; WHILE THE FOURTH EVALUATES THE PERFORMANCE OF GENERAL AND SPECIFIC CONTEXTUALIZED WORD EMBEDDINGS ON THE BIONER TASK. RESULTS SHOW THAT THE CLASSIC GENERAL WORD EMBEDDING GLOVE COMMON CRAWL PERFORMED BETTER IN THE DRUGBANK CORPUS, DESPITE HAVING LESS WORD COVERAGE AND A LOWER INTERNAL SEMANTIC RELATIONSHIP THAN THE CLASSIC SPECIFIC WORD EMBEDDING, PYYSALO PM + PMC; WHILE IN THE CONTEXTUALIZED WORD EMBEDDINGS THE BEST RESULTS ARE PRESENTED IN THE SPECIFIC ONES. WE CONCLUDE, THEREFORE, WHEN USING CLASSIC WORD EMBEDDINGS AS FEATURES ON THE BIONER TASK, THE GENERAL ONES COULD BE CONSIDERED A GOOD OPTION. ON THE OTHER HAND, WHEN USING CONTEXTUALIZED WORD EMBEDDINGS, THE SPECIFIC ONES ARE THE BEST OPTION.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
COMPARISON OF DEEP LEARNING MODELS FOR NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING-BASED CLASSIFICATION OF NON-ENGLISH HEAD CT REPORTS. PURPOSE: NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) CAN BE USED FOR AUTOMATIC FLAGGING OF RADIOLOGY REPORTS. WE ASSESSED DEEP LEARNING MODELS FOR CLASSIFYING NON-ENGLISH HEAD CT REPORTS. METHODS: WE RETROSPECTIVELY COLLECTED HEAD CT REPORTS (2011-2018). REPORTS WERE SIGNED IN HEBREW. EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT (ED) REPORTS OF ADULT PATIENTS FROM JANUARY TO FEBRUARY FOR EACH YEAR (2013-2018) WERE MANUALLY LABELED. ALL OTHER REPORTS WERE USED TO PRE-TRAIN AN EMBEDDING LAYER. WE EXPLORED TWO USE CASES: (1) GENERAL LABELING USE CASE, IN WHICH REPORTS WERE LABELED AS NORMAL VS. PATHOLOGICAL; (2) SPECIFIC LABELING USE CASE, IN WHICH REPORTS WERE LABELED AS WITH AND WITHOUT INTRA-CRANIAL HEMORRHAGE. WE TESTED LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY (LSTM) AND LSTM-ATTENTION (LSTM-ATN) NETWORKS FOR CLASSIFYING REPORTS. WE ALSO EVALUATED THE IMPROVEMENT OF ADDING WORD2VEC WORD EMBEDDING. DEEP LEARNING MODELS WERE COMPARED WITH A BAG-OF-WORDS (BOW) MODEL. RESULTS: WE RETRIEVED 176,988 HEAD CT REPORTS FOR PRE-TRAINING. WE MANUALLY LABELED 7784 REPORTS AS NORMAL (46.3%) OR PATHOLOGICAL (53.7%), AND 7.1% WITH INTRA-CRANIAL HEMORRHAGE. FOR THE GENERAL LABELING, LSTM-ATN-WORD2VEC SHOWED THE BEST RESULTS (AUC = 0.967 +/- 0.006, ACCURACY 90.8% +/- 0.01). FOR THE SPECIFIC LABELING, ALL METHODS SHOWED SIMILAR ACCURACIES BETWEEN 95.0 AND 95.9%. BOTH LSTM-ATN-WORD2VEC AND BOW HAD THE HIGHEST AUC (0.970). CONCLUSION: FOR A GENERAL USE CASE, WORD EMBEDDING USING A LARGE COHORT OF NON-ENGLISH HEAD CT REPORTS AND ATN IMPROVES NLP PERFORMANCE. FOR A MORE SPECIFIC TASK, BOW AND DEEP LEARNING SHOWED SIMILAR RESULTS. MODELS SHOULD BE EXPLORED AND TAILORED TO THE NLP TASK.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
COMPARISON OF NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION METHODOLOGIES IN BIOMEDICAL DOCUMENTS. BACKGROUND: BIOMEDICAL NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION (BIO-NER) IS A FUNDAMENTAL TASK IN HANDLING BIOMEDICAL TEXT TERMS, SUCH AS RNA, PROTEIN, CELL TYPE, CELL LINE, AND DNA. BIO-NER IS ONE OF THE MOST ELEMENTARY AND CORE TASKS IN BIOMEDICAL KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY FROM TEXTS. THE SYSTEM DESCRIBED HERE IS DEVELOPED BY USING THE BIONLP/NLPBA 2004 SHARED TASK. EXPERIMENTS ARE CONDUCTED ON A TRAINING AND EVALUATION SET PROVIDED BY THE TASK ORGANIZERS. RESULTS: OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT, COMPARED WITH A BASELINE HAVING A 70.09% F1 SCORE, THE RNN JORDAN- AND ELMAN-TYPE ALGORITHMS HAVE F1 SCORES OF APPROXIMATELY 60.53% AND 58.80%, RESPECTIVELY. WHEN WE USE CRF AS A MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHM, CCA, GLOVE, AND WORD2VEC HAVE F1 SCORES OF 72.73%, 72.74%, AND 72.82%, RESPECTIVELY. CONCLUSIONS: BY USING THE WORD EMBEDDING CONSTRUCTED THROUGH THE UNSUPERVISED LEARNING, THE TIME AND COST REQUIRED TO CONSTRUCT THE LEARNING DATA CAN BE SAVED.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
COMPARISON OF WORD AND CHARACTER LEVEL INFORMATION FOR MEDICAL TERM IDENTIFICATION USING CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS AND TRANSFORMERS. COMPLEXITY AND DOMAIN-SPECIFICITY MAKE MEDICAL TEXT HARD TO UNDERSTAND FOR PATIENTS AND THEIR NEXT OF KIN. TO SIMPLIFY SUCH TEXT, THIS PAPER EXPLORED HOW WORD AND CHARACTER LEVEL INFORMATION CAN BE LEVERAGED TO IDENTIFY MEDICAL TERMS WHEN TRAINING DATA IS LIMITED. WE CREATED A DATASET OF MEDICAL AND GENERAL TERMS USING THE HUMAN DISEASE ONTOLOGY FROM BIOPORTAL AND WIKIPEDIA PAGES. OUR RESULTS FROM 10-FOLD CROSS VALIDATION INDICATED THAT CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS (CNNS) AND TRANSFORMERS PERFORM COMPETITIVELY. THE BEST F SCORE OF 93.9% WAS ACHIEVED BY A CNN TRAINED ON BOTH WORD AND CHARACTER LEVEL EMBEDDINGS. STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE TESTS DEMONSTRATED THAT GENERAL WORD EMBEDDINGS PROVIDE RICH WORD REPRESENTATIONS FOR MEDICAL TERM IDENTIFICATION. CONSEQUENTLY, FOCUSING ON WORDS IS FAVORABLE FOR MEDICAL TERM IDENTIFICATION IF USING DEEP LEARNING ARCHITECTURES.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
COMPARISON OF WORD EMBEDDINGS FOR EXTRACTION FROM MEDICAL RECORDS. THIS PAPER IS AN EXTENSION OF THE WORK ORIGINALLY PRESENTED IN THE 16TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON WEARABLE, MICRO AND NANO TECHNOLOGIES FOR PERSONALIZED HEALTH. DESPITE USING ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS, FREE NARRATIVE TEXT IS STILL WIDELY USED FOR MEDICAL RECORDS. TO MAKE DATA FROM TEXTS AVAILABLE FOR DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS, SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS MIGHT BE SUCCESSFULLY APPLIED. IN THIS WORK, WE DEVELOPED AND COMPARED A PROTOTYPE OF A MEDICAL DATA EXTRACTION SYSTEM BASED ON DIFFERENT ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK ARCHITECTURES TO PROCESS FREE MEDICAL TEXTS IN THE RUSSIAN LANGUAGE. THREE CLASSIFIERS WERE APPLIED TO EXTRACT ENTITIES FROM SNIPPETS OF TEXT. MULTI-LAYER PERCEPTRON (MLP) AND CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (CNN) CLASSIFIERS SHOWED SIMILAR RESULTS TO ALL THREE EMBEDDING MODELS. MLP EXCEEDED CONVOLUTIONAL NETWORK ON PIPELINES THAT USED THE EMBEDDING MODEL TRAINED ON MEDICAL RECORDS WITH PRELIMINARY LEMMATIZATION. NEVERTHELESS, THE HIGHEST F-SCORE WAS ACHIEVED BY CNN. CNN SLIGHTLY EXCEEDED MLP WHEN THE BIGGEST WORD2VEC MODEL WAS APPLIED (F-SCORE 0.9763).

VACCINATION IS AN EFFECTIVE WAY TO COMBAT THIS VIRUS AND PREVENT ITS SPREADING AMONG INDIVIDUALS. CURRENTLY, THERE ARE MORE THAN 50 SARS-COV-2 VACCINE CANDIDATES IN TRIALS; ONLY A FEW OF THEM ARE ALREADY IN USE. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY IS TO ANALYSE THE PUBLIC AWARENESS AND OPINION TOWARD THE VACCINATION PROCESS AND TO DEVELOP A MODEL THAT PREDICTS THE AWARENESS AND ACCEPTABILITY OF SARS-COV-2 VACCINES IN SAUDI ARABIA BY ANALYSING A DATASET OF ARABIC TWEETS RELATED TO VACCINATION. THEREFORE, SEVERAL MACHINE LEARNING MODELS SUCH AS SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE (SVM), NAIVE BAYES (NB), AND LOGISTIC REGRESSION (LR), SIDEWAYS WITH THE N-GRAM AND TERM FREQUENCY-INVERSE DOCUMENT FREQUENCY (TF-IDF) TECHNIQUES FOR FEATURE EXTRACTION AND LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY (LSTM) MODEL USED WITH WORD EMBEDDING. LR WITH UNIGRAM FEATURE EXTRACTION HAS ACHIEVED THE BEST ACCURACY, RECALL, AND F1 SCORE WITH SCORES OF 0.76, 0.69, AND 0.72, RESPECTIVELY. HOWEVER, THE BEST PRECISION VALUE OF 0.80 WAS ACHIEVED USING SVM WITH UNIGRAM AND NB WITH BIGRAM TF-IDF. HOWEVER, THE LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY (LSTM) MODEL OUTPERFORMED THE OTHER MODELS WITH AN ACCURACY OF 0.95, A PRECISION OF 0.96, A RECALL OF 0.95, AND AN F1 SCORE OF 0.95. THIS MODEL WILL HELP IN GAINING A COMPLETE IDEA OF HOW RECEPTIVE PEOPLE ARE TO THE VACCINE. THUS, THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE ABLE TO FIND NEW WAYS AND RUN MORE CAMPAIGNS TO RAISE AWARENESS OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THE VACCINE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
COMPUTATIONAL METHODS FOR PREDICTING AND UNDERSTANDING FOOD JUDGMENT. PEOPLE MAKE SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE HEALTHINESS OF DIFFERENT FOODS EVERY DAY, AND THESE JUDGMENTS IN TURN INFLUENCE THEIR FOOD CHOICES AND HEALTH OUTCOMES. DESPITE THE IMPORTANCE OF SUCH JUDGMENTS, THERE ARE FEW QUANTITATIVE THEORIES ABOUT THEIR PSYCHOLOGICAL UNDERPINNINGS. THIS ARTICLE INTRODUCES A NOVEL COMPUTATIONAL APPROACH THAT CAN APPROXIMATE PEOPLE'S KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTATIONS FOR THOUSANDS OF COMMON FOODS. WE USED THESE REPRESENTATIONS TO PREDICT HOW BOTH LAY DECISION-MAKERS (THE GENERAL POPULATION) AND EXPERTS JUDGE THE HEALTHINESS OF INDIVIDUAL FOODS. WE ALSO APPLIED OUR METHOD TO PREDICT THE IMPACT OF BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS, SUCH AS THE PROVISION OF FRONT-OF-PACK NUTRIENT AND CALORIE INFORMATION. ACROSS MULTIPLE STUDIES WITH DATA FROM 846 ADULTS, OUR MODELS ACHIEVED VERY HIGH ACCURACY RATES (R(2) = .65-.77) AND SIGNIFICANTLY OUTPERFORMED COMPETING MODELS BASED ON FACTUAL NUTRITIONAL CONTENT. THESE RESULTS ILLUSTRATE HOW NEW COMPUTATIONAL METHODS APPLIED TO ESTABLISHED PSYCHOLOGICAL THEORY CAN BE USED TO BETTER PREDICT, UNDERSTAND, AND INFLUENCE HEALTH BEHAVIOR.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
COMPUTERIZATION OF OFF-TOPIC ESSAY DETECTION: A POSSIBILITY? CHECKING ESSAYS WRITTEN BY STUDENTS IS A VERY TIME CONSUMING TASK. BESIDES SPELLINGS AND GRAMMAR, THEY ALSO NEED TO BE EVALUATED ON THEIR SEMANTIC CONTENT SUCH AS COHESION, COHERENCE, ETC. IN THIS STUDY WE FOCUS ON ONE SUCH ASPECT OF SEMANTIC CONTENT WHICH IS THE TOPIC OF THE ESSAY. PUTTING IT FORMALLY, GIVEN A PROMPT OR ESSAY-STATEMENT AND AN ESSAY, THIS STUDY AIMS TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OF PREDICTING WHETHER THE ESSAY IS OFF-TOPIC OR NOT USING MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES. WITH AN INCREASE IN ONLINE LEARNING AND EVALUATION PLATFORMS ESPECIALLY DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, THE OFF-TOPIC DETECTION SYSTEM CAN BE VERY USEFUL TO CHECK ESSAYS THAT ARE MAINLY SUBMITTED ONLINE. IN THIS PAPER, WE ANSWER THE QUESTION: GIVEN A PROMPT AND AN ESSAY WRITTEN IN PAKISTANI ENGLISH, CAN THE PROCESS OF DETECTING WHETHER THE ESSAY IS OFF-TOPIC OR NOT BE RELIABLY AND COMPLETELY AUTONOMIZED WITH ZERO HUMAN INTERVENTION USING CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES? FOR THIS PURPOSE, WE EXPLORE AND IMPLEMENT VARIOUS EMBEDDING TECHNIQUES PROPOSED IN RECENT YEARS TO EXTRACT SIMILARITY OR DISSIMILARITY FEATURES BETWEEN QUESTION AND RESPONSE, AND COMPARE THE PERFORMANCE OF THESE TECHNIQUES USING 10 BENCHMARK DATA SETS AND 6 CLASSIFIERS. WITH DIFFERENT CLASSIFIERS AND DIFFERENT DATASETS ALONG WITH DIFFERENT EMBEDDINGS, WE CONCLUDE THAT COMBINING WORD MOVER DISTANCE, AVERAGE WORD EMBEDDINGS AND IDF WEIGHTED WORD EMBEDDINGS TOGETHER AND THEN USING RANDOM FOREST AS THE CLASSIFIER IS THE BEST COMBINATION FOR OFF-TOPIC ESSAY DETECTION. THE ACCURACY OBTAINED IS 93.5%.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
CONCEPT EMBEDDING FOR RELEVANCE DETECTION OF SEARCH QUERIES REGARDING CHOP. AUTOMATIC ENCODING OF DIAGNOSIS AND PROCEDURES CAN INCREASE THE INTEROPERABILITY AND EFFICACY OF THE CLINICAL COOPERATION. THE CONCEPT, RULE-BASED AND MACHINE LEARNING CLASSIFICATION METHODS FOR AUTOMATIC CODE GENERATION CAN EASILY REACH THEIR LIMIT DUE TO THE HANDCRAFTED RULES AND A LIMITED COVERAGE OF THE VOCABULARY IN A CONCEPT LIBRARY. AS THE FIRST STEP TO APPLY DEEP LEARNING METHODS IN AUTOMATIC ENCODING IN THE CLINICAL DOMAIN, A SUITABLE SEMANTIC REPRESENTATION SHOULD BE GENERATED. IN THIS WORK, WE WILL FOCUS ON THE EMBEDDING MECHANISM AND DIMENSIONAL REDUCTION METHOD FOR TEXT REPRESENTATION, WHICH MITIGATE THE SPARSENESS OF THE DATA INPUT IN THE CLINICAL DOMAIN. DIFFERENT METHODS SUCH AS WORD EMBEDDING AND RANDOM PROJECTION WILL BE EVALUATED BASED ON LOGS OF QUERY-DOCUMENT MATCHING.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
CONCEPTVECTOR: TEXT VISUAL ANALYTICS VIA INTERACTIVE LEXICON BUILDING USING WORD EMBEDDING. CENTRAL TO MANY TEXT ANALYSIS METHODS IS THE NOTION OF A CONCEPT: A SET OF SEMANTICALLY RELATED KEYWORDS CHARACTERIZING A SPECIFIC OBJECT, PHENOMENON, OR THEME. ADVANCES IN WORD EMBEDDING ALLOW BUILDING A CONCEPT FROM A SMALL SET OF SEED TERMS. HOWEVER, NAIVE APPLICATION OF SUCH TECHNIQUES MAY RESULT IN FALSE POSITIVE ERRORS BECAUSE OF THE POLYSEMY OF NATURAL LANGUAGE. TO MITIGATE THIS PROBLEM, WE PRESENT A VISUAL ANALYTICS SYSTEM CALLED CONCEPTVECTOR THAT GUIDES A USER IN BUILDING SUCH CONCEPTS AND THEN USING THEM TO ANALYZE DOCUMENTS. DOCUMENT-ANALYSIS CASE STUDIES WITH REAL-WORLD DATASETS DEMONSTRATE THE FINE-GRAINED ANALYSIS PROVIDED BY CONCEPTVECTOR. TO SUPPORT THE ELABORATE MODELING OF CONCEPTS, WE INTRODUCE A BIPOLAR CONCEPT MODEL AND SUPPORT FOR SPECIFYING IRRELEVANT WORDS. WE VALIDATE THE INTERACTIVE LEXICON BUILDING INTERFACE BY A USER STUDY AND EXPERT REVIEWS. QUANTITATIVE EVALUATION SHOWS THAT THE BIPOLAR LEXICON GENERATED WITH OUR METHODS IS COMPARABLE TO HUMAN-GENERATED ONES.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
CONJOINT FEATURE REPRESENTATION OF GO AND PROTEIN SEQUENCE FOR PPI PREDICTION BASED ON AN INCEPTION RNN ATTENTION NETWORK. PROTEIN-PROTEIN INTERACTIONS (PPIS) ARE PIVOTAL FOR CELLULAR FUNCTIONS AND BIOLOGICAL PROCESSES. IN THE PAST YEARS, COMPUTATIONAL METHODS USING AMINO ACID SEQUENCES AND GENE ONTOLOGY (GO) ANNOTATIONS OF PROTEINS FOR PRIORITIZING PPIS HAVE PROVIDED IMPORTANT REFERENCES FOR BIOLOGICAL EXPERIMENTS IN THE WET LAB. DESPITE THE CURRENT SUCCESS, SEQUENCE INFORMATION AND ONTOLOGICAL ANNOTATION IN SEMANTIC REPRESENTATION HAVE NOT BEEN INTEGRATED INTO CURRENT METHODS. WE PROPOSE A DEEP-LEARNING-BASED PPI PREDICTION METHODOLOGY CONJOINTLY FEATURING SEQUENCE INFORMATION AND GO ANNOTATION. FIRST, WE ADOPT A WORD-EMBEDDING TOOL, THE NCBI-BLUEBERT MODEL PRE-TRAINED ON PUBMED, TO MAP THE GO TERMS INTO THEIR SEMANTIC VECTORS. THEN, THE GO SEMANTIC VECTORS AND PROTEIN SEQUENCE VECTOR SERVE AS THE INPUT OF THE PROPOSED INCEPTION RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORK (RNN) ATTENTION NETWORK (IRAN). THE IRAN CAPTURES THE SPATIAL RELATIONSHIP AND THE POTENTIAL SEQUENTIAL FEATURE OF THE PROTEIN SEQUENCE AND ONTOLOGICAL ANNOTATION SEMANTICS. THE EXTENSIVE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS ON 12 BENCHMARKS DEMONSTRATE THAT OUR METHOD ACHIEVES SUPERIORITY OVER STATE-OF-THE-ART BASELINES. IN THE YEAST DATASET OF A BINARY PPI PREDICTION, OUR METHOD IMPROVED THE PERFORMANCE WITH THE MATTHEWS CORRELATION COEFFICIENT INCREASING FROM 94.2% TO 98.2% AND THE ACCURACY FROM 97.1% TO 98.2%. THE ANALOGOUS RESULTS WERE ALSO OBTAINED IN OTHER COMPARISON EVALUATIONS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
CONSPIRACY THEORIES ON TWITTER: EMERGING MOTIFS AND TEMPORAL DYNAMICS DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC RESULTED IN AN UPSURGE IN THE SPREAD OF DIVERSE CONSPIRACY THEORIES (CTS) WITH REAL-LIFE IMPACT. HOWEVER, THE DYNAMICS OF USER ENGAGEMENT REMAIN UNDER-RESEARCHED. IN THE PRESENT STUDY, WE LEVERAGE TWITTER DATA ACROSS 11 MONTHS IN 2020 FROM THE TIMELINES OF 109 CT POSTERS AND A COMPARISON GROUP (NON-CT GROUP) OF EQUAL SIZE. WITHIN THIS APPROACH, WE USED WORD EMBEDDINGS TO DISTINGUISH NON-CT CONTENT FROM CT-RELATED CONTENT AS WELL AS ANALYSED WHICH ELEMENT OF CT CONTENT EMERGED IN THE PANDEMIC. SUBSEQUENTLY, WE APPLIED TIME SERIES ANALYSES ON THE AGGREGATE AND INDIVIDUAL LEVEL TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CT POSTERS AND NON-CT POSTERS IN NON-CT TWEETS AS WELL AS THE TEMPORAL DYNAMICS OF CT TWEETS. IN THIS REGARD, WE PROVIDE A DESCRIPTION OF THE AGGREGATE AND INDIVIDUAL SERIES, CONDUCTED A STL DECOMPOSITION IN TRENDS, SEASONS, AND ERRORS, AS WELL AS AN AUTOCORRELATION ANALYSIS, AND APPLIED GENERALISED ADDITIVE MIXED MODELS TO ANALYSE NONLINEAR TRENDS AND THEIR DIFFERENCES ACROSS USERS. THE NARRATIVE MOTIFS, CHARACTERISED BY WORD EMBEDDINGS, ADDRESS PANDEMIC-SPECIFIC MOTIFS ALONGSIDE BROADER MOTIFS AND CAN BE RELATED TO SEVERAL PSYCHOLOGICAL NEEDS (EPISTEMIC, EXISTENTIAL, OR SOCIAL). OVERALL, THE COMPARISON OF THE CT GROUP AND NON-CT GROUP SHOWED A SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER LEVEL OF OVERALL COVID-19-RELATED TWEETS IN THE NON-CT GROUP AND HIGHER LEVEL OF RANDOM FLUCTUATIONS. FOCUSSING ON CONSPIRACY TWEETS, WE FOUND A SLIGHT POSITIVE TREND BUT, MORE IMPORTANTLY, AN INCREASE IN USERS IN 2020. MOREOVER, THE AGGREGATE SERIES OF CT CONTENT REVEALED TWO BREAKS IN 2020 AND A SIGNIFICANT ALBEIT WEAK POSITIVE TREND SINCE JUNE. ON THE INDIVIDUAL LEVEL, THE SERIES SHOWED STRONG DIFFERENCES IN TEMPORAL DYNAMICS AND A HIGH DEGREE OF RANDOMNESS AND DAY-SPECIFIC SENSITIVITY. THE RESULTS STRESS THE IMPORTANCE OF TWITTER AS A MEANS OF COMMUNICATION DURING THE PANDEMIC AND ILLUSTRATE THAT THESE BELIEFS TRAVEL VERY FAST AND ARE QUICKLY ENDORSED.

CONSTRUCTION AND RESEARCH ON CHINESE SEMANTIC MAPPING BASED ON LINGUISTIC FEATURES AND SPARSE SELF-LEARNING NEURAL NETWORKS. IN THIS PAPER, WE ADOPT THE ALGORITHMS OF LINGUISTIC FEATURE RONG AND SPARSE SELF-LEARNING NEURAL NETWORK TO CONDUCT AN IN-DEPTH STUDY AND ANALYSIS OF CHINESE SEMANTIC MAPPING, WHICH COMPLEMENTS THE EMOTION SEMANTIC REPRESENTATION ABILITY OF TRADITIONAL WORD EMBEDDING AND FULLY EXPLORES THE EMOTION SEMANTIC INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE TEXT IN THE TASK PREPROCESSING STAGE. WE INCORPORATE VARIOUS SEMANTIC FEATURES SUCH AS LEXICAL INFORMATION AND LOCATION INFORMATION TO MAKE THE MODEL HAVE RICHER EMOTION SEMANTIC EXPRESSION, AND THE MODEL ALSO USES AN ATTENTION MECHANISM TO ALLOW VARIOUS FEATURES TO INTERACT AND ABSTRACT DEEPER CONTEXTUAL INTERNAL SEMANTIC ASSOCIATIONS TO IMPROVE THE MODEL'S SENTIMENT CLASSIFICATION PERFORMANCE. FINALLY, EXPERIMENTS ARE CONDUCTED ON TWO PUBLICLY AVAILABLE ENGLISH SENTIMENT CLASSIFICATION CORPORA, AND THE RESULTS PROVE THAT THE MODEL OUTPERFORMS OTHER COMPARISON MODELS AND EFFECTIVELY IMPROVES THE SENTIMENT CLASSIFICATION PERFORMANCE. THE MODEL USES DEEP MEMORY NETWORKS AND CAPSULE NETWORKS TO CONSTRUCT A TRANSFER LEARNING FRAMEWORK AND EFFECTIVELY LEVERAGES THE TRANSFER LEARNING PROPERTIES OF CAPSULE NETWORKS TO TRANSFER KNOWLEDGE EMBEDDED IN LARGE-SCALE LABELED DATA FROM SIMILAR DOMAINS TO THE TARGET DOMAIN, IMPROVING THE CLASSIFICATION PERFORMANCE ON SMALL DATA SETS. THE USE OF MULTIDIMENSIONAL COMBINED FEATURES COMPENSATES FOR THE LACK OF A ONE-DIMENSIONAL FEATURE ATTENTION MECHANISM, WHILE MULTIPLE DOMAIN CATEGORY-BASED ATTENTION COMPUTATION LAYERS ARE SUPERIMPOSED TO OBTAIN DEEPER DOMAIN-SPECIFIC SENTIMENT FEATURE INFORMATION. BASED ON THE SEGMENTED CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK, THE MODEL FIRST INTRODUCES THE DEPENDENT SUBTREE OF RELATIONAL ATTRIBUTES TO OBTAIN THE POSITION WEIGHTS OF EACH WORD IN THE SENTENCE, THEN INTRODUCES DOMAIN ONTOLOGY KNOWLEDGE IN THE OUTPUT LAYER TO CONSTRAIN THE EXTRACTION RESULTS, AND CONDUCTS EXPERIMENTAL COMPARISON THROUGH THE DATA SET TO VERIFY THE VALIDITY OF THE MODEL, WHICH ENSURES THE ACCURACY OF THE NETWORK TERM ENTITY AND RELATIONAL ATTRIBUTE RECOGNITION EXTRACTION AND MAKES THE KNOWLEDGE MAP CONSTRUCTED IN THIS PAPER. IT ENSURES THE ACCURACY OF THE EXTRACTION RATE OF THE WEB TERM ENTITIES AND RELATIONSHIP ATTRIBUTES AND MAKES THE KNOWLEDGE MAP CONSTRUCTED IN THIS PAPER MORE FACTUAL.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
CONSTRUCTION AND UTILIZATION OF A NEURAL NETWORK MODEL TO PREDICT CURRENT PROCEDURAL TERMINOLOGY CODES FROM PATHOLOGY REPORT TEXTS. BACKGROUND: AT OUR DEPARTMENT, EACH SPECIMEN WAS ASSIGNED A TENTATIVE CURRENT PROCEDURAL TERMINOLOGY (CPT) CODE AT ACCESSIONING. THE CODES WERE SUBJECT TO SUBSEQUENT CHANGES BY PATHOLOGIST ASSISTANTS AND PATHOLOGISTS. AFTER THE CASES HAD BEEN FINALIZED, THEIR CPT CODES WENT THROUGH A FINAL VERIFICATION STEP BY CODING STAFF, WITH THE AID OF A KEYWORD-BASED CPT CODE-CHECKING WEB APPLICATION. GREATER THAN 97% OF THE INITIAL ASSIGNMENTS WERE CORRECT. THIS ARTICLE DESCRIBES THE CONSTRUCTION OF A CPT CODE-PREDICTING NEURAL NETWORK MODEL AND ITS INCORPORATION INTO THE CPT CODE-CHECKING APPLICATION. MATERIALS AND METHODS: R PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE WAS USED. PATHOLOGY REPORT TEXTS AND CPT CODES FOR THE CASES FINALIZED DURING JANUARY 1-NOVEMBER 30, 2018, WERE RETRIEVED FROM THE DATABASE. THE ORDER OF THE SPECIMENS WAS RANDOMIZED BEFORE THE DATA WERE PARTITIONED INTO TRAINING AND VALIDATION SET. R KERAS PACKAGE WAS USED FOR BOTH MODEL TRAINING AND PREDICTION. THE CHOSEN NEURAL NETWORK HAD A THREE-LAYER ARCHITECTURE CONSISTING OF A WORD-EMBEDDING LAYER, A BIDIRECTIONAL LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY (LSTM) LAYER, AND A DENSELY CONNECTED LAYER. IT USED CONCATENATED HEADER-DIAGNOSIS TEXTS AS THE INPUT. RESULTS: THE MODEL PREDICTED CPT CODES IN BOTH THE VALIDATION DATA SET AND THE TEST DATA SET WITH AN ACCURACY OF 97.5% AND 97.6%, RESPECTIVELY. CLOSER EXAMINATION OF THE TEST DATA SET (CASES FROM DECEMBER 1 TO 27, 2018) REVEALED TWO INTERESTING OBSERVATIONS. FIRST, AMONG THE SPECIMENS THAT HAD INCORRECT INITIAL CPT CODE ASSIGNMENTS, THE MODEL DISAGREED WITH THE INITIAL ASSIGNMENTS IN 73.6% (117/159) AND AGREED IN 26.4% (42/159). SECOND, THE MODEL IDENTIFIED NINE ADDITIONAL SPECIMENS WITH INCORRECT CPT CODES THAT HAD EVADED ALL STEPS OF CHECKING. CONCLUSIONS: A NEURAL NETWORK MODEL USING REPORT TEXTS TO PREDICT CPT CODES CAN ACHIEVE HIGH ACCURACY IN PREDICTION AND MODERATE SENSITIVITY IN ERROR DETECTION. NEURAL NETWORKS MAY PLAY INCREASING ROLES IN CPT CODING IN SURGICAL PATHOLOGY.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
CONTEXT-AWARE ATTENTIVE MULTILEVEL FEATURE FUSION FOR NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION. IN THE ERA OF INFORMATION EXPLOSION, NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION (NER) HAS ATTRACTED WIDESPREAD ATTENTION IN THE FIELD OF NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING, AS IT IS FUNDAMENTAL TO INFORMATION EXTRACTION. RECENTLY, METHODS OF NER BASED ON REPRESENTATION LEARNING, E.G., CHARACTER EMBEDDING AND WORD EMBEDDING, HAVE DEMONSTRATED PROMISING RECOGNITION RESULTS. HOWEVER, EXISTING MODELS ONLY CONSIDER PARTIAL FEATURES DERIVED FROM WORDS OR CHARACTERS WHILE FAILING TO INTEGRATE SEMANTIC AND SYNTACTIC INFORMATION, E.G., CAPITALIZATION, INTER-WORD RELATIONS, KEYWORDS, AND LEXICAL PHRASES, FROM MULTILEVEL PERSPECTIVES. INTUITIVELY, MULTILEVEL FEATURES CAN BE HELPFUL WHEN RECOGNIZING NAMED ENTITIES FROM COMPLEX SENTENCES. IN THIS STUDY, WE PROPOSE A NOVEL ATTENTIVE MULTILEVEL FEATURE FUSION (AMFF) MODEL FOR NER, WHICH CAPTURES THE MULTILEVEL FEATURES IN THE CURRENT CONTEXT FROM VARIOUS PERSPECTIVES. IT CONSISTS OF FOUR COMPONENTS TO, RESPECTIVELY, CAPTURE THE LOCAL CHARACTER-LEVEL (CL), GLOBAL CHARACTER-LEVEL (CG), LOCAL WORD-LEVEL (WL), AND GLOBAL WORD-LEVEL (WG) FEATURES IN THE CURRENT CONTEXT. IN ADDITION, WE FURTHER DEFINE DOCUMENT-LEVEL FEATURES CRAFTED FROM OTHER SENTENCES TO ENHANCE THE REPRESENTATION LEARNING OF THE CURRENT CONTEXT. TO THIS END, WE INTRODUCE A NOVEL CONTEXT-AWARE ATTENTIVE MULTILEVEL FEATURE FUSION (CAMFF) MODEL BASED ON AMFF, TO FULLY LEVERAGE DOCUMENT-LEVEL FEATURES FROM ALL THE PREVIOUS INPUTS. THE OBTAINED MULTILEVEL FEATURES ARE THEN FUSED AND FED INTO A BIDIRECTIONAL LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY (BILSTM)-CONDITIONAL RANDOM FIELD (CRF) NETWORK FOR THE FINAL SEQUENCE LABELING. EXTENSIVE EXPERIMENTS ON FOUR BENCHMARK DATASETS DEMONSTRATE THAT OUR PROPOSED AMFF AND CAMFF MODELS OUTPERFORM A SET OF STATE-OF-THE-ART BASELINE METHODS AND THE FEATURES LEARNED FROM MULTIPLE LEVELS ARE COMPLEMENTARY.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
CONTEXT-BASED SENTIMENT ANALYSIS ON CUSTOMER REVIEWS USING MACHINE LEARNING LINEAR MODELS. CUSTOMER SATISFACTION AND THEIR POSITIVE SENTIMENTS ARE SOME OF THE VARIOUS GOALS FOR SUCCESSFUL COMPANIES. HOWEVER, ANALYZING CUSTOMER REVIEWS TO PREDICT ACCURATE SENTIMENTS HAVE BEEN PROVEN TO BE CHALLENGING AND TIME-CONSUMING DUE TO HIGH VOLUMES OF COLLECTED DATA FROM VARIOUS SOURCES. SEVERAL RESEARCHERS APPROACH THIS WITH ALGORITHMS, METHODS, AND MODELS. THESE INCLUDE MACHINE LEARNING AND DEEP LEARNING (DL) METHODS, UNIGRAM AND SKIP-GRAM BASED ALGORITHMS, AS WELL AS THE ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK (ANN) AND BAG-OF-WORD (BOW) REGRESSION MODEL. STUDIES AND RESEARCH HAVE REVEALED INCOHERENCE IN POLARITY, MODEL OVERFITTING AND PERFORMANCE ISSUES, AS WELL AS HIGH COST IN DATA PROCESSING. THIS EXPERIMENT WAS CONDUCTED TO SOLVE THESE REVEALING ISSUES, BY BUILDING A HIGH PERFORMANCE YET COST-EFFECTIVE MODEL FOR PREDICTING ACCURATE SENTIMENTS FROM LARGE DATASETS CONTAINING CUSTOMER REVIEWS. THIS MODEL USES THE FASTTEXT LIBRARY FROM FACEBOOK'S AI RESEARCH (FAIR) LAB, AS WELL AS THE TRADITIONAL LINEAR SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE (LSVM) TO CLASSIFY TEXT AND WORD EMBEDDING. COMPARISONS OF THIS MODEL WERE ALSO DONE WITH THE AUTHOR'S A CUSTOM MULTI-LAYER SENTIMENT ANALYSIS (SA) BI-DIRECTIONAL LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY (SA-BLSTM) MODEL. THE PROPOSED FASTTEXT MODEL, BASED ON RESULTS, OBTAINS A HIGHER ACCURACY OF 90.71% AS WELL AS 20% IN PERFORMANCE COMPARED TO LSVM AND SA-BLSTM MODELS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
CONTEXT-ENRICHED LEARNING MODELS FOR ALIGNING BIOMEDICAL VOCABULARIES AT SCALE IN THE UMLS METATHESAURUS. THE UNIFIED MEDICAL LANGUAGE SYSTEM (UMLS) METATHESAURUS CONSTRUCTION PROCESS MAINLY RELIES ON LEXICAL ALGORITHMS AND MANUAL EXPERT CURATION FOR INTEGRATING OVER 200 BIOMEDICAL VOCABULARIES. A LEXICAL-BASED LEARNING MODEL (LEXLM) WAS DEVELOPED TO PREDICT SYNONYMY AMONG METATHESAURUS TERMS AND LARGELY OUTPERFORMS A RULE-BASED APPROACH (RBA) THAT APPROXIMATES THE CURRENT CONSTRUCTION PROCESS. HOWEVER, THE LEXLM HAS THE POTENTIAL FOR BEING IMPROVED FURTHER BECAUSE IT ONLY USES LEXICAL INFORMATION FROM THE SOURCE VOCABULARIES, WHILE THE RBA ALSO TAKES ADVANTAGE OF CONTEXTUAL INFORMATION. WE INVESTIGATE THE ROLE OF MULTIPLE TYPES OF CONTEXTUAL INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO THE UMLS EDITORS, NAMELY SOURCE SYNONYMY (SS), SOURCE SEMANTIC GROUP (SG), AND SOURCE HIERARCHICAL RELATIONS (HR), FOR THE UMLS VOCABULARY ALIGNMENT (UVA) PROBLEM. IN THIS PAPER, WE DEVELOP MULTIPLE VARIANTS OF CONTEXT-ENRICHED LEARNING MODELS (CONLMS) BY ADDING TO THE LEXLM THE TYPES OF CONTEXTUAL INFORMATION LISTED ABOVE. WE REPRESENT THESE CONTEXT TYPES IN CONTEXT-ENRICHED KNOWLEDGE GRAPHS (CONKGS) WITH FOUR VARIANTS CONSS, CONSG, CONHR, AND CONALL. WE TRAIN THESE CONKG EMBEDDINGS USING SEVEN KG EMBEDDING TECHNIQUES. WE CREATE THE CONLMS BY CONCATENATING THE CONKG EMBEDDING VECTORS WITH THE WORD EMBEDDING VECTORS FROM THE LEXLM. WE EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE CONLMS USING THE UVA GENERALIZATION TEST DATASETS WITH HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF PAIRS. OUR EXTENSIVE EXPERIMENTS SHOW A SIGNIFICANT PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT FROM THE CONLMS OVER THE LEXLM, NAMELY +5.0% IN PRECISION (93.75%), +0.69% IN RECALL (93.23%), +2.88% IN F1 (93.49%) FOR THE BEST CONLM. OUR EXPERIMENTS ALSO SHOW THAT THE CONALL VARIANT INCLUDING THE THREE CONTEXT TYPES TAKES MORE TIME, BUT DOES NOT ALWAYS PERFORM BETTER THAN OTHER VARIANTS WITH A SINGLE CONTEXT TYPE. FINALLY, OUR EXPERIMENTS SHOW THAT THE PAIRS OF TERMS WITH HIGH LEXICAL SIMILARITY BENEFIT MOST FROM ADDING CONTEXTUAL INFORMATION, NAMELY +6.56% IN PRECISION (94.97%), +2.13% IN RECALL (93.23%), +4.35% IN F1 (94.09%) FOR THE BEST CONLM. THE PAIRS WITH LOWER DEGREES OF LEXICAL SIMILARITY ALSO SHOW PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT WITH +0.85% IN F1 (96%) FOR LOW SIMILARITY AND +1.31% IN F1 (96.34%) FOR NO SIMILARITY. THESE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THE IMPORTANCE OF USING CONTEXTUAL INFORMATION IN THE UVA PROBLEM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
CONTEXT-FUSED GUIDANCE FOR IMAGE CAPTIONING USING SEQUENCE-LEVEL TRAINING. RECENT IMAGE CAPTIONING MODELS BASED ON THE ENCODER-DECODER FRAMEWORK HAVE ACHIEVED REMARKABLE SUCCESS IN HUMANLIKE SENTENCE GENERATION. HOWEVER, AN EXPLICIT SEPARATION BETWEEN ENCODER AND DECODER BRINGS OUT A DISCONNECTION BETWEEN THE IMAGE AND SENTENCE. IT USUALLY LEADS TO A ROUGH IMAGE DESCRIPTION: THE GENERATED CAPTION ONLY CONTAINS MAIN INSTANCES BUT NEGLECTS ADDITIONAL OBJECTS AND SCENES UNEXPECTEDLY, WHICH REDUCES THE CAPTION CONSISTENCY OF THE IMAGE. TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE, WE PROPOSED AN IMAGE CAPTIONING SYSTEM WITHIN CONTEXT-FUSED GUIDANCE IN THIS PAPER. IT INCORPORATES REGIONAL AND GLOBAL IMAGE REPRESENTATION AS THE COMPOSITIONAL VISUAL FEATURES TO LEARN THE OBJECTS AND ATTRIBUTES IN IMAGES. TO INTEGRATE IMAGE-LEVEL SEMANTIC INFORMATION, THE VISUAL CONCEPT IS EMPLOYED. TO AVOID MISLEADING DECODING, A CONTEXT FUSION GATE IS INTRODUCED TO CALCULATE THE TEXTUAL CONTEXT BY SELECTIVELY AGGREGATING THE INFORMATION OF VISUAL CONCEPT AND WORD EMBEDDING. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE CONTEXT-FUSED IMAGE GUIDANCE IS FORMULATED BASED ON THE COMPOSITIONAL VISUAL FEATURES AND TEXTUAL CONTEXT. IT PROVIDES THE DECODER WITH INFORMATIVE SEMANTIC KNOWLEDGE. FINALLY, A CAPTIONER WITH A TWO-LAYER LSTM ARCHITECTURE IS CONSTRUCTED TO GENERATE CAPTIONS. MOREOVER, TO OVERCOME THE EXPOSURE BIAS, WE TRAIN THE PROPOSED MODEL THROUGH SEQUENCE DECISION-MAKING. THE EXPERIMENTS CONDUCTED ON THE MS COCO DATASET SHOW THE OUTSTANDING PERFORMANCE OF OUR WORK. THE LINGUISTIC ANALYSIS DEMONSTRATES THAT OUR MODEL IMPROVES THE CAPTION CONSISTENCY OF THE IMAGE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
CREATING NEUROSCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE ORGANIZATION SYSTEM BASED ON WORD REPRESENTATION AND AGGLOMERATIVE CLUSTERING ALGORITHM. THE LITERATURE ON NEUROSCIENCE HAS GROWN RAPIDLY IN RECENT YEARS WITH THE EMERGENCE OF NEW DOMAINS OF RESEARCH. IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS PROGRESS, CREATING A KNOWLEDGE ORGANIZATION SYSTEM (KOS) THAT CAN QUICKLY INCORPORATE TERMS OF A GIVEN DOMAIN IS AN IMPORTANT AIM IN THE AREA. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE DEVELOP A SYSTEMATIC METHOD BASED ON WORD REPRESENTATION AND THE AGGLOMERATIVE CLUSTERING ALGORITHM TO SEMI-AUTOMATICALLY BUILD A HIERARCHICAL KOS. WE COLLECTED 35,832 RESEARCH KEYWORDS AND 11,497 RESEARCH METHODS FROM PUBMED CENTRAL DATABASE, AND ORGANIZED THEM IN A HIERARCHICAL STRUCTURE ACCORDING TO SEMANTIC DISTANCE. WE SHOW THAT THE PROPOSED KOS CAN HELP FIND TERMS RELATED TO THE GIVEN TOPICS, ANALYZE ARTICLES RELATED TO SPECIFIC DOMAINS OF RESEARCH, AND CHARACTERIZE THE FEATURES OF ARTICLE CLUSTERS. THE PROPOSED METHOD CAN SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE MANUAL WORK REQUIRED BY EXPERTS TO ORGANIZE THE KOS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
CREPHAN: CROSS-SPECIES PREDICTION OF ENHANCERS BY USING HIERARCHICAL ATTENTION NETWORKS. MOTIVATION: ENHANCERS ARE IMPORTANT FUNCTIONAL ELEMENTS IN GENOME SEQUENCES. THE IDENTIFICATION OF ENHANCERS IS A VERY CHALLENGING TASK DUE TO THE GREAT DIVERSITY OF ENHANCER SEQUENCES AND THE FLEXIBLE LOCALIZATION ON GENOMES. TILL NOW, THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN ENHANCERS AND GENES HAVE NOT BEEN FULLY UNDERSTOOD YET. TO SPEED UP THE STUDIES OF THE REGULATORY ROLES OF ENHANCERS, COMPUTATIONAL TOOLS FOR THE PREDICTION OF ENHANCERS HAVE EMERGED IN RECENT YEARS. ESPECIALLY, THANKS TO THE ENCODE PROJECT AND THE ADVANCES OF HIGH-THROUGHPUT EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES, A LARGE AMOUNT OF EXPERIMENTALLY VERIFIED ENHANCERS HAVE BEEN ANNOTATED ON THE HUMAN GENOME, WHICH ALLOWS LARGE-SCALE PREDICTIONS OF UNKNOWN ENHANCERS USING DATA-DRIVEN METHODS. HOWEVER, EXCEPT FOR HUMAN AND SOME MODEL ORGANISMS, THE VALIDATED ENHANCER ANNOTATIONS ARE SCARCE FOR MOST SPECIES, LEADING TO MORE DIFFICULTIES IN THE COMPUTATIONAL IDENTIFICATION OF ENHANCERS FOR THEIR GENOMES. RESULTS: IN THIS STUDY, WE PROPOSE A DEEP LEARNING-BASED PREDICTOR FOR ENHANCERS, NAMED CREPHAN, WHICH IS FEATURED BY A HIERARCHICAL ATTENTION NEURAL NETWORK AND WORD EMBEDDING-BASED REPRESENTATIONS FOR DNA SEQUENCES. WE USE THE EXPERIMENTALLY-SUPPORTED DATA OF THE HUMAN GENOME TO TRAIN THE MODEL, AND PERFORM EXPERIMENTS ON HUMAN AND OTHER MAMMALS, INCLUDING MOUSE, COW, AND DOG. THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS SHOW THAT CREPHAN HAS MORE ADVANTAGES ON CROSS-SPECIES PREDICTIONS, AND OUTPERFORMS THE EXISTING MODELS BY A LARGE MARGIN. ESPECIALLY, FOR HUMAN-MOUSE CROSS-PREDICTIONS, THE AUC SCORE OF ROC CURVE IS INCREASED BY 0.033 APPROXIMATELY 0.145 ON THE COMBINED TISSUE DATASET AND 0.032 APPROXIMATELY 0.109 ON TISSUE-SPECIFIC DATASETS.

DECODING AND ENCODING MODELS REVEAL THE ROLE OF MENTAL SIMULATION IN THE BRAIN REPRESENTATION OF MEANING. HOW THE BRAIN REPRESENTATION OF CONCEPTUAL KNOWLEDGE VARIES AS A FUNCTION OF PROCESSING GOALS, STRATEGIES AND TASK-FACTORS REMAINS A KEY UNRESOLVED QUESTION IN COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE. IN THE PRESENT FUNCTIONAL MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING STUDY, PARTICIPANTS WERE PRESENTED WITH VISUAL WORDS DURING FUNCTIONAL MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (FMRI). DURING SHALLOW PROCESSING, PARTICIPANTS HAD TO READ THE ITEMS. DURING DEEP PROCESSING, THEY HAD TO MENTALLY SIMULATE THE FEATURES ASSOCIATED WITH THE WORDS. MULTIVARIATE CLASSIFICATION, INFORMATIONAL CONNECTIVITY AND ENCODING MODELS WERE USED TO REVEAL HOW THE DEPTH OF PROCESSING DETERMINES THE BRAIN REPRESENTATION OF WORD MEANING. DECODING ACCURACY IN PUTATIVE SUBSTRATES OF THE SEMANTIC NETWORK WAS ENHANCED WHEN THE DEPTH PROCESSING WAS HIGH, AND THE BRAIN REPRESENTATIONS WERE MORE GENERALIZABLE IN SEMANTIC SPACE RELATIVE TO SHALLOW PROCESSING CONTEXTS. THIS PATTERN WAS OBSERVED EVEN IN ASSOCIATION AREAS IN INFERIOR FRONTAL AND PARIETAL CORTEX. DEEP INFORMATION PROCESSING DURING MENTAL SIMULATION ALSO INCREASED THE INFORMATIONAL CONNECTIVITY WITHIN KEY SUBSTRATES OF THE SEMANTIC NETWORK. TO FURTHER EXAMINE THE PROPERTIES OF THE WORDS ENCODED IN BRAIN ACTIVITY, WE COMPARED COMPUTER VISION MODELS-ASSOCIATED WITH THE IMAGE REFERENTS OF THE WORDS-AND WORD EMBEDDING. COMPUTER VISION MODELS EXPLAINED MORE VARIANCE OF THE BRAIN RESPONSES ACROSS MULTIPLE AREAS OF THE SEMANTIC NETWORK. THESE RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE BRAIN REPRESENTATION OF WORD MEANING IS HIGHLY MALLEABLE BY THE DEPTH OF PROCESSING IMPOSED BY THE TASK, RELIES ON ACCESS TO VISUAL REPRESENTATIONS AND IS HIGHLY DISTRIBUTED, INCLUDING PREFRONTAL AREAS PREVIOUSLY IMPLICATED IN SEMANTIC CONTROL.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
DECODING EEG BRAIN ACTIVITY FOR MULTI-MODAL NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING. UNTIL RECENTLY, HUMAN BEHAVIORAL DATA FROM READING HAS MAINLY BEEN OF INTEREST TO RESEARCHERS TO UNDERSTAND HUMAN COGNITION. HOWEVER, THESE HUMAN LANGUAGE PROCESSING SIGNALS CAN ALSO BE BENEFICIAL IN MACHINE LEARNING-BASED NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING TASKS. USING EEG BRAIN ACTIVITY FOR THIS PURPOSE IS LARGELY UNEXPLORED AS OF YET. IN THIS PAPER, WE PRESENT THE FIRST LARGE-SCALE STUDY OF SYSTEMATICALLY ANALYZING THE POTENTIAL OF EEG BRAIN ACTIVITY DATA FOR IMPROVING NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING TASKS, WITH A SPECIAL FOCUS ON WHICH FEATURES OF THE SIGNAL ARE MOST BENEFICIAL. WE PRESENT A MULTI-MODAL MACHINE LEARNING ARCHITECTURE THAT LEARNS JOINTLY FROM TEXTUAL INPUT AS WELL AS FROM EEG FEATURES. WE FIND THAT FILTERING THE EEG SIGNALS INTO FREQUENCY BANDS IS MORE BENEFICIAL THAN USING THE BROADBAND SIGNAL. MOREOVER, FOR A RANGE OF WORD EMBEDDING TYPES, EEG DATA IMPROVES BINARY AND TERNARY SENTIMENT CLASSIFICATION AND OUTPERFORMS MULTIPLE BASELINES. FOR MORE COMPLEX TASKS SUCH AS RELATION DETECTION, ONLY THE CONTEXTUALIZED BERT EMBEDDINGS OUTPERFORM THE BASELINES IN OUR EXPERIMENTS, WHICH RAISES THE NEED FOR FURTHER RESEARCH. FINALLY, EEG DATA SHOWS TO BE PARTICULARLY PROMISING WHEN LIMITED TRAINING DATA IS AVAILABLE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
DECODING NATURALISTIC EXPERIENCES FROM HUMAN BRAIN ACTIVITY VIA DISTRIBUTED REPRESENTATIONS OF WORDS. NATURAL VISUAL SCENES INDUCE RICH PERCEPTUAL EXPERIENCES THAT ARE HIGHLY DIVERSE FROM SCENE TO SCENE AND FROM PERSON TO PERSON. HERE, WE PROPOSE A NEW FRAMEWORK FOR DECODING SUCH EXPERIENCES USING A DISTRIBUTED REPRESENTATION OF WORDS. WE USED FUNCTIONAL MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (FMRI) TO MEASURE BRAIN ACTIVITY EVOKED BY NATURAL MOVIE SCENES. THEN, WE CONSTRUCTED A HIGH-DIMENSIONAL FEATURE SPACE OF PERCEPTUAL EXPERIENCES USING SKIP-GRAM, A STATE-OF-THE-ART DISTRIBUTED WORD EMBEDDING MODEL. WE BUILT A DECODER THAT ASSOCIATES BRAIN ACTIVITY WITH PERCEPTUAL EXPERIENCES VIA THE DISTRIBUTED WORD REPRESENTATION. THE DECODER SUCCESSFULLY ESTIMATED PERCEPTUAL CONTENTS CONSISTENT WITH THE SCENE DESCRIPTIONS BY MULTIPLE ANNOTATORS. OUR RESULTS ILLUSTRATE THREE ADVANTAGES OF OUR DECODING FRAMEWORK: (1) THREE TYPES OF PERCEPTUAL CONTENTS COULD BE DECODED IN THE FORM OF NOUNS (OBJECTS), VERBS (ACTIONS), AND ADJECTIVES (IMPRESSIONS) CONTAINED IN 10,000 VOCABULARY WORDS; (2) DESPITE USING SUCH A LARGE VOCABULARY, WE COULD DECODE NOVEL WORDS THAT WERE ABSENT IN THE DATASETS TO TRAIN THE DECODER; AND (3) THE INTER-INDIVIDUAL VARIABILITY OF THE DECODED CONTENTS CO-VARIED WITH THAT OF THE CONTENTS OF SCENE DESCRIPTIONS. THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT OUR DECODING FRAMEWORK CAN RECOVER DIVERSE ASPECTS OF PERCEPTUAL EXPERIENCES IN NATURALISTIC SITUATIONS AND COULD BE USEFUL IN VARIOUS SCIENTIFIC AND PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
DECODING THE LANGUAGE OF MICROBIOMES USING WORD-EMBEDDING TECHNIQUES, AND APPLICATIONS IN INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE. MICROBIOMES ARE COMPLEX ECOLOGICAL SYSTEMS THAT PLAY CRUCIAL ROLES IN UNDERSTANDING NATURAL PHENOMENA FROM HUMAN DISEASE TO CLIMATE CHANGE. ESPECIALLY IN HUMAN GUT MICROBIOME STUDIES, WHERE COLLECTING CLINICAL SAMPLES CAN BE ARDUOUS, THE NUMBER OF TAXA CONSIDERED IN ANY ONE STUDY OFTEN EXCEEDS THE NUMBER OF SAMPLES TEN TO ONE HUNDRED-FOLD. THIS DISCREPANCY DECREASES THE POWER OF STUDIES TO IDENTIFY MEANINGFUL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SAMPLES, INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD OF FALSE POSITIVE RESULTS, AND SUBSEQUENTLY LIMITS REPRODUCIBILITY. DESPITE THE VAST COLLECTIONS OF MICROBIOME DATA ALREADY AVAILABLE, BIOME-SPECIFIC PATTERNS OF MICROBIAL STRUCTURE ARE NOT CURRENTLY LEVERAGED TO INFORM STUDIES. HERE, WE DERIVE MICROBIOME-LEVEL PROPERTIES BY APPLYING AN EMBEDDING ALGORITHM TO QUANTIFY TAXON CO-OCCURRENCE PATTERNS IN OVER 18,000 SAMPLES FROM THE AMERICAN GUT PROJECT (AGP) MICROBIOME CROWDSOURCING EFFORT. WE THEN COMPARE THE PREDICTIVE POWER OF MODELS TRAINED USING PROPERTIES, NORMALIZED TAXONOMIC COUNT DATA, AND ANOTHER COMMONLY USED DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION METHOD, PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS IN CATEGORIZING SAMPLES FROM INDIVIDUALS WITH INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE (IBD) AND HEALTHY CONTROLS. WE SHOW THAT PREDICTIVE MODELS TRAINED USING PROPERTY DATA ARE THE MOST ACCURATE, ROBUST, AND GENERALIZABLE, AND THAT PROPERTY-BASED MODELS CAN BE TRAINED ON ONE DATASET AND DEPLOYED ON ANOTHER WITH POSITIVE RESULTS. FURTHERMORE, WE FIND THAT PROPERTIES CORRELATE SIGNIFICANTLY WITH KNOWN METABOLIC PATHWAYS. USING THESE PROPERTIES, WE ARE ABLE TO EXTRACT KNOWN AND NEW BACTERIAL METABOLIC PATHWAYS ASSOCIATED WITH INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE ACROSS TWO COMPLETELY INDEPENDENT STUDIES. BY PROVIDING A SET OF PRE-TRAINED EMBEDDINGS, WE ALLOW ANY V4 16S AMPLICON STUDY TO APPLY THE PUBLICLY INFORMED PROPERTIES TO INCREASE THE STATISTICAL POWER, REPRODUCIBILITY, AND GENERALIZABILITY OF ANALYSIS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
DEEP ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS REVEAL A DISTRIBUTED CORTICAL NETWORK ENCODING PROPOSITIONAL SENTENCE-LEVEL MEANING. UNDERSTANDING HOW AND WHERE IN THE BRAIN SENTENCE-LEVEL MEANING IS CONSTRUCTED FROM WORDS PRESENTS A MAJOR SCIENTIFIC CHALLENGE. RECENT ADVANCES HAVE BEGUN TO EXPLAIN BRAIN ACTIVATION ELICITED BY SENTENCES USING VECTOR MODELS OF WORD MEANING DERIVED FROM PATTERNS OF WORD CO-OCCURRENCE IN TEXT CORPORA. THESE STUDIES HAVE HELPED MAP OUT SEMANTIC REPRESENTATION ACROSS A DISTRIBUTED BRAIN NETWORK SPANNING TEMPORAL, PARIETAL, AND FRONTAL CORTEX. HOWEVER, IT REMAINS UNCLEAR WHETHER ACTIVATION PATTERNS WITHIN REGIONS REFLECT UNIFIED REPRESENTATIONS OF SENTENCE-LEVEL MEANING, AS OPPOSED TO SUPERPOSITIONS OF CONTEXT-INDEPENDENT COMPONENT WORDS. THIS IS BECAUSE MODELS HAVE TYPICALLY REPRESENTED SENTENCES AS "BAGS-OF-WORDS" THAT NEGLECT SENTENCE-LEVEL STRUCTURE. TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE, WE INTERROGATED FMRI ACTIVATION ELICITED AS 240 SENTENCES WERE READ BY 14 PARTICIPANTS (9 FEMALE, 5 MALE), USING SENTENCES ENCODED BY A RECURRENT DEEP ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK TRAINED ON A SENTENCE INFERENCE TASK (INFERSENT). RECURRENT CONNECTIONS AND NONLINEAR FILTERS ENABLE INFERSENT TO TRANSFORM SEQUENCES OF WORD VECTORS INTO UNIFIED "PROPOSITIONAL" SENTENCE REPRESENTATIONS SUITABLE FOR EVALUATING INTERSENTENCE ENTAILMENT RELATIONS. USING VOXELWISE ENCODING MODELING, WE DEMONSTRATE THAT INFERSENT PREDICTS ELEMENTS OF FMRI ACTIVATION THAT CANNOT BE PREDICTED BY BAG-OF-WORDS MODELS AND SENTENCE MODELS USING GRAMMATICAL RULES TO ASSEMBLE WORD VECTORS. THIS EFFECT OCCURS THROUGHOUT A DISTRIBUTED NETWORK, WHICH SUGGESTS THAT PROPOSITIONAL SENTENCE-LEVEL MEANING IS REPRESENTED WITHIN AND ACROSS MULTIPLE CORTICAL REGIONS RATHER THAN AT ANY SINGLE SITE. IN FOLLOW-UP ANALYSES, WE PLACE RESULTS IN THE CONTEXT OF OTHER DEEP NETWORK APPROACHES (ELMO AND BERT) AND ESTIMATE THE DEGREE OF UNPREDICTED NEURAL SIGNAL USING AN "EXPERIENTIAL" SEMANTIC MODEL AND CROSS-PARTICIPANT ENCODING.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT A MODERN-DAY SCIENTIFIC CHALLENGE IS TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE HUMAN BRAIN TRANSFORMS WORD SEQUENCES INTO REPRESENTATIONS OF SENTENCE MEANING. A RECENT APPROACH, EMERGING FROM ADVANCES IN FUNCTIONAL NEUROIMAGING, BIG DATA, AND MACHINE LEARNING, IS TO COMPUTATIONALLY MODEL MEANING, AND USE MODELS TO PREDICT BRAIN ACTIVITY. SUCH MODELS HAVE HELPED MAP A CORTICAL SEMANTIC INFORMATION-PROCESSING NETWORK. HOWEVER, HOW UNIFIED SENTENCE-LEVEL INFORMATION, AS OPPOSED TO WORD-LEVEL UNITS, IS REPRESENTED THROUGHOUT THIS NETWORK REMAINS UNCLEAR. THIS IS BECAUSE MODELS HAVE TYPICALLY REPRESENTED SENTENCES AS UNORDERED "BAGS-OF-WORDS." USING A DEEP ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK THAT RECURRENTLY AND NONLINEARLY COMBINES WORD REPRESENTATIONS INTO UNIFIED PROPOSITIONAL SENTENCE REPRESENTATIONS, WE PROVIDE EVIDENCE THAT SENTENCE-LEVEL INFORMATION IS ENCODED THROUGHOUT A CORTICAL NETWORK, RATHER THAN IN A SINGLE REGION.

HOWEVER, MOST STUDIES DIVIDE THE LONG TEXT INTO WORDS AND COUNT WORDS TO TREAT THE TEXT AS WORD COUNT VECTORS, BRINGING MASSIVE INVALID INFORMATION BUT IGNORING MEANINGFUL CONTEXTS. AIMING TO EFFICIENTLY REPRESENT THE TEXT OF LARGE SIZE, AN END-TO-END NEURAL NETWORKS MODEL BASED ON HIERARCHICAL SELF-ATTENTION IS PROPOSED IN THIS STUDY AFTER THE STATE-OF-THE-ART PRETRAINED MODEL IS INTRODUCED FOR TEXT EMBEDDING INCLUDING CONTEXTS. THE PROPOSED MODEL HAS TWO NOTABLE CHARACTERISTICS. FIRST, THE HIERARCHICAL SELF-ATTENTION ONLY AFFORDS THE ESSENTIAL CONTENT WITH HIGH WEIGHTS IN WORD-LEVEL AND SENTENCE-LEVEL AND AUTOMATICALLY NEGLECTS LOTS OF INFORMATION THAT HAS NO BUSINESS WITH RISK PREDICTION, WHICH IS SUITABLE FOR EXTRACTING EFFECTIVE PARTS OF THE LARGE-SCALE TEXT. SECOND, AFTER FINE-TUNING, THE WORD EMBEDDING ADAPTS THE SPECIFIC CONTEXTS OF SAMPLES AND CONVEYS THE ORIGINAL TEXT EXPRESSION MORE ACCURATELY WITHOUT EXCESSIVE MANUAL OPERATIONS. EXPERIMENTS CONFIRM THAT THE ADDITION OF TEXT IMPROVES THE ACCURACY OF FINANCIAL DISTRESS FORECASTING AND THE PROPOSED MODEL OUTPERFORMS BENCHMARK MODELS BETTER AT AUC AND F2-SCORE. FOR VISUALIZATION, THE ELEMENTS IN THE WEIGHT MATRIX OF HIERARCHICAL SELF-ATTENTION ACT AS SCALERS TO ESTIMATE THE IMPORTANCE OF EACH WORD AND SENTENCE. IN THIS WAY, THE "RED-FLAG" STATEMENT THAT IMPLIES FINANCIAL RISK IS FIGURED OUT AND HIGHLIGHTED IN THE ORIGINAL TEXT, PROVIDING EFFECTIVE REFERENCES FOR DECISION-MAKERS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
DEEP LEARNING FOR PHARMACOVIGILANCE: RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORK ARCHITECTURES FOR LABELING ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS IN TWITTER POSTS. OBJECTIVE: SOCIAL MEDIA IS AN IMPORTANT PHARMACOVIGILANCE DATA SOURCE FOR ADVERSE DRUG REACTION (ADR) IDENTIFICATION. HUMAN REVIEW OF SOCIAL MEDIA DATA IS INFEASIBLE DUE TO DATA QUANTITY, THUS NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING TECHNIQUES ARE NECESSARY. SOCIAL MEDIA INCLUDES INFORMAL VOCABULARY AND IRREGULAR GRAMMAR, WHICH CHALLENGE NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING METHODS. OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO DEVELOP A SCALABLE, DEEP-LEARNING APPROACH THAT EXCEEDS STATE-OF-THE-ART ADR DETECTION PERFORMANCE IN SOCIAL MEDIA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: WE DEVELOPED A RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORK (RNN) MODEL THAT LABELS WORDS IN AN INPUT SEQUENCE WITH ADR MEMBERSHIP TAGS. THE ONLY INPUT FEATURES ARE WORD-EMBEDDING VECTORS, WHICH CAN BE FORMED THROUGH TASK-INDEPENDENT PRETRAINING OR DURING ADR DETECTION TRAINING. RESULTS: OUR BEST-PERFORMING RNN MODEL USED PRETRAINED WORD EMBEDDINGS CREATED FROM A LARGE, NON-DOMAIN-SPECIFIC TWITTER DATASET. IT ACHIEVED AN APPROXIMATE MATCH F-MEASURE OF 0.755 FOR ADR IDENTIFICATION ON THE DATASET, COMPARED TO 0.631 FOR A BASELINE LEXICON SYSTEM AND 0.65 FOR THE STATE-OF-THE-ART CONDITIONAL RANDOM FIELD MODEL. FEATURE ANALYSIS INDICATED THAT SEMANTIC INFORMATION IN PRETRAINED WORD EMBEDDINGS BOOSTED SENSITIVITY AND, COMBINED WITH CONTEXTUAL AWARENESS CAPTURED IN THE RNN, PRECISION. DISCUSSION: OUR MODEL REQUIRED NO TASK-SPECIFIC FEATURE ENGINEERING, SUGGESTING GENERALIZABILITY TO ADDITIONAL SEQUENCE-LABELING TASKS. LEARNING CURVE ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT OUR MODEL REACHED OPTIMAL PERFORMANCE WITH FEWER TRAINING EXAMPLES THAN THE OTHER MODELS. CONCLUSION: ADR DETECTION PERFORMANCE IN SOCIAL MEDIA IS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED BY USING A CONTEXTUALLY AWARE MODEL AND WORD EMBEDDINGS FORMED FROM LARGE, UNLABELED DATASETS. THE APPROACH REDUCES MANUAL DATA-LABELING REQUIREMENTS AND IS SCALABLE TO LARGE SOCIAL MEDIA DATASETS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
DEEP LEARNING MODELLING OF PUBLIC'S SENTIMENTS TOWARDS TEMPORAL EVOLUTION OF COVID-19 TRANSMISSION. PUBLIC SENTIMENTS TOWARDS GLOBAL PANDEMICS ARE IMPORTANT FOR PUBLIC HEALTH ASSESSMENT AND DISEASE CONTROL. THIS STUDY DEVELOPS A MODULARIZED DEEP LEARNING FRAMEWORK TO QUANTIFY PUBLIC SENTIMENTS TOWARDS COVID-19, FOLLOWED BY LEVERAGING THE PREDICTED SENTIMENTS TO MODEL AND FORECAST THE DAILY GROWTH RATE OF CONFIRMED COVID-19 CASES GLOBALLY, VIA A PROPOSED G PARAMETER. IN THE PROPOSED FRAMEWORK, PUBLIC SENTIMENTS ARE FIRST MODELED VIA A VALENCE DIMENSIONAL INDICATOR, INSTEAD OF DISCRETE SCHEMAS, AND ARE CLASSIFIED INTO 4 PRIMARY EMOTIONAL CATEGORIES: (A) NEUTRAL; (B) NEGATIVE; (C) POSITIVE; (D) AMBIVALENT, BY USING MULTIPLE WORD EMBEDDING MODELS AND CLASSIFIERS FOR TEXT SENTIMENTS ANALYSES AND CLASSIFICATION. THE TRAINED MODEL IS SUBSEQUENTLY APPLIED TO ANALYZE LARGE VOLUMES (MILLIONS IN QUANTITY) OF DAILY TWEETS PERTAINING TO COVID-19, RANGING FROM 22 JAN 2020 TO 10 MAY 2020. THE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT THE GLOBAL COMMUNITY GRADUALLY EVOKES BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE SENTIMENTS TOWARDS COVID-19 OVER TIME COMPARED TO THE DOMINANT NEURAL EMOTION AT ITS INCEPTION. THE PREDICTED TIME-SERIES SENTIMENTS ARE THEN LEVERAGED TO TRAIN A DEEP NEURAL NETWORK (DNN) TO MODEL AND FORECAST THE G PARAMETER BY ACHIEVING THE LOWEST POSSIBLE MEAN ABSOLUTE PERCENTAGE ERROR (MAPE) SCORE OF AROUND 17.0% DURING THE MODEL'S TESTING STEP WITH THE OPTIMAL MODEL CONFIGURATION.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
DEEP LEARNING PREDICTS EXTREME PRETERM BIRTH FROM ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS. OBJECTIVE: MODELS FOR PREDICTING PRETERM BIRTH GENERALLY HAVE FOCUSED ON VERY PRETERM (28-32WEEKS) AND MODERATE TO LATE PRETERM (32-37WEEKS) SETTINGS. HOWEVER, EXTREME PRETERM BIRTH (EPB), BEFORE THE 28TH WEEK OF GESTATIONAL AGE, ACCOUNTS FOR THE MAJORITY OF NEWBORN DEATHS. WE INVESTIGATED THE EXTENT TO WHICH DEEP LEARNING MODELS THAT CONSIDER TEMPORAL RELATIONS DOCUMENTED IN ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS (EHRS) CAN PREDICT EPB. STUDY DESIGN: EHR DATA WERE SUBJECT TO WORD EMBEDDING AND A TEMPORAL DEEP LEARNING MODEL, IN THE FORM OF RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORKS (RNNS) TO PREDICT EPB. DUE TO THE LOW PREVALENCE OF EPB, THE MODELS WERE TRAINED ON DATASETS WHERE CONTROLS WERE UNDERSAMPLED TO BALANCE THE CASE-CONTROL RATIO. WE THEN APPLIED AN ENSEMBLE APPROACH TO GROUP THE TRAINED MODELS TO PREDICT EPB IN AN EVALUATION SETTING WITH A NATURE EPB RATIO. WE EVALUATED THE RNN ENSEMBLE MODELS WITH 10YEARS OF EHR DATA FROM 25,689 DELIVERIES AT VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER. WE COMPARED THEIR PERFORMANCE WITH TRADITIONAL MACHINE LEARNING MODELS (LOGISTICAL REGRESSION, SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE, GRADIENT BOOSTING) TRAINED ON THE DATASETS WITH BALANCED AND NATURAL EPB RATIO. RISK FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH EPB WERE IDENTIFIED USING AN ADJUSTED ODDS RATIO. RESULTS: THE RNN ENSEMBLE MODELS TRAINED ON ARTIFICIALLY BALANCED DATA ACHIEVED A HIGHER AUC (0.827 VS. 0.744) AND SENSITIVITY (0.965 VS. 0.682) THAN THOSE RNN MODELS TRAINED ON THE DATASETS WITH NATURALLY IMBALANCED EPB RATIO. IN ADDITION, THE AUC (0.827) AND SENSITIVITY (0.965) OF THE RNN ENSEMBLE MODELS WERE BETTER THAN THE AUC (0.777) AND SENSITIVITY (0.819) OF THE BEST BASELINE MODELS TRAINED ON BALANCED DATA. ALSO, RISK FACTORS, INCLUDING TWIN PREGNANCY, SHORT CERVICAL LENGTH, HYPERTENSIVE DISORDER, SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS, AND HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE SULFATE, WERE FOUND TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH EPB AT A SIGNIFICANT LEVEL. CONCLUSION: TEMPORAL DEEP LEARNING CAN PREDICT EPB UP TO 8WEEKS EARLIER THAN ITS OCCURRENCE. ACCURATE PREDICTION OF EPB MAY ALLOW HEALTHCARE ORGANIZATIONS TO ALLOCATE RESOURCES EFFECTIVELY AND ENSURE PATIENTS RECEIVE APPROPRIATE CARE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
DEEP LEARNING-BASED TEXT EMOTION ANALYSIS FOR LEGAL ANOMIE. TEXT EMOTION ANALYSIS IS AN EFFECTIVE WAY FOR ANALYZING THE EMOTION OF THE SUBJECTS' ANOMIE BEHAVIORS. THIS PAPER PROPOSES A TEXT EMOTION ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK (CALLED BCDF) BASED ON WORD EMBEDDING AND SPLICING. BI-DIRECTION CONVOLUTIONAL WORD EMBEDDING CLASSIFICATION FRAMEWORK (BCDF) CAN EXPRESS THE WORD VECTOR IN THE TEXT AND EMBED THE PART OF SPEECH TAGGING INFORMATION AS A FEATURE OF SENTENCE REPRESENTATION. IN ADDITION, AN EMOTIONAL PARALLEL LEARNING MECHANISM IS PROPOSED, WHICH USES THE TEMPORAL INFORMATION OF THE PARALLEL STRUCTURE CALCULATED BY BI-LSTM TO UPDATE THE STORAGE INFORMATION THROUGH THE GATING MECHANISM. THE CONVOLUTIONAL LAYER CAN BETTER EXTRACT CERTAIN COMPONENTS OF SENTENCES (SUCH AS ADJECTIVES, ADVERBS, NOUNS, ETC.), WHICH PLAY A MORE SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN THE EXPRESSION OF EMOTION. TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF CONVOLUTION, A CONVOLUTIONAL LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY (CONVLSTM) NETWORK IS DESIGNED TO FURTHER IMPROVE THE CLASSIFICATION RESULTS. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS SHOW THAT COMPARED WITH TRADITIONAL LSTM MODEL, THE PROPOSED TEXT EMOTION ANALYSIS MODEL HAS INCREASED 3.3 AND 10.9% F1 SCORE ON PSYCHOLOGICAL AND NEWS TEXT DATASETS, RESPECTIVELY. THE PROPOSED CBDM MODEL BASED ON BI-LSTM AND CONVLSTM HAS GREAT VALUE IN PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS OF ANOMIE BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
DEEP NEURAL NETWORK FRAMEWORK BASED ON WORD EMBEDDING FOR PROTEIN GLUTARYLATION SITES PREDICTION. IN RECENT YEARS, MUCH RESEARCH HAS FOUND THAT DYSREGULATION OF GLUTARYLATION IS ASSOCIATED WITH MANY HUMAN DISEASES, SUCH AS DIABETES, CANCER, AND GLUTARIC ACIDURIA TYPE I. THEREFORE, GLUTARYLATION IDENTIFICATION AND CHARACTERIZATION ARE ESSENTIAL TASKS FOR DETERMINING MODIFICATION-SPECIFIC PROTEOMICS. THIS STUDY AIMS TO PROPOSE A NOVEL DEEP NEURAL NETWORK FRAMEWORK BASED ON WORD EMBEDDING TECHNIQUES FOR GLUTARYLATION SITES PREDICTION. MULTIPLE DEEP NEURAL NETWORK MODELS ARE IMPLEMENTED TO EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE OF GLUTARYLATION SITES PREDICTION. FURTHERMORE, AN EXTENSIVE EXPERIMENTAL COMPARISON OF WORD EMBEDDING TECHNIQUES IS CONDUCTED TO UTILIZE THE MOST EFFICIENT METHOD FOR IMPROVING PROTEIN SEQUENCE DATA REPRESENTATION. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE PROPOSED DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS NOT ONLY IMPROVE PROTEIN SEQUENCE REPRESENTATION BUT ALSO WORK EFFECTIVELY IN GLUTARYLATION SITES PREDICTION BY OBTAINING A HIGHER ACCURACY AND CONFIDENCE RATE COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUS WORK. MOREOVER, EMBEDDING TECHNIQUES WERE PROVEN TO BE MORE PRODUCTIVE THAN THE PRE-TRAINED WORD EMBEDDING TECHNIQUES FOR GLUTARYLATION SEQUENCE REPRESENTATION. OUR PROPOSED METHOD HAS SIGNIFICANTLY OUTPERFORMED ALL TRADITIONAL PERFORMANCE METRICS COMPARED TO THE ADVANCED INTEGRATED VECTOR SUPPORT, WITH ACCURACY, SPECIFICITY, SENSITIVITY, AND CORRELATION COEFFICIENT OF 0.79, 0.89, 0.59, AND 0.51, RESPECTIVELY. IT SHOWS THE POTENTIAL TO DETECT NEW GLUTARYLATION SITES AND UNCOVER THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN GLUTARYLATION AND WELL-KNOWN LYSINE MODIFICATION.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS FOR INFERRING BINDING SITES OF RNA-BINDING PROTEINS BY USING DISTRIBUTED REPRESENTATIONS OF RNA PRIMARY SEQUENCE AND SECONDARY STRUCTURE. BACKGROUND: RNA BINDING PROTEINS (RBPS) PLAY A VITAL ROLE IN POST-TRANSCRIPTIONAL PROCESSES IN ALL EUKARYOTES, SUCH AS SPLICING REGULATION, MRNA TRANSPORT, AND MODULATION OF MRNA TRANSLATION AND DECAY. THE IDENTIFICATION OF RBP BINDING SITES IS A CRUCIAL STEP IN UNDERSTANDING THE BIOLOGICAL MECHANISM OF POST-TRANSCRIPTIONAL GENE REGULATION. HOWEVER, THE DETERMINATION OF RBP BINDING SITES ON A LARGE SCALE IS A CHALLENGING TASK DUE TO HIGH COST OF BIOCHEMICAL ASSAYS. QUITE A NUMBER OF STUDIES HAVE EXPLOITED MACHINE LEARNING METHODS TO PREDICT BINDING SITES. ESPECIALLY, DEEP LEARNING IS INCREASINGLY USED IN THE BIOINFORMATICS FIELD BY VIRTUE OF ITS ABILITY TO LEARN GENERALIZED REPRESENTATIONS FROM DNA AND PROTEIN SEQUENCES. RESULTS: IN THIS PAPER, WE IMPLEMENTED A NOVEL DEEP NEURAL NETWORK MODEL, DEEPRKE, WHICH COMBINES PRIMARY RNA SEQUENCE AND SECONDARY STRUCTURE INFORMATION TO EFFECTIVELY PREDICT RBP BINDING SITES. SPECIFICALLY, WE USED WORD EMBEDDING ALGORITHM TO EXTRACT FEATURES OF RNA SEQUENCES AND SECONDARY STRUCTURES, I.E., DISTRIBUTED REPRESENTATION OF K-MERS SEQUENCE RATHER THAN TRADITIONAL ONE-HOT ENCODING. THE DISTRIBUTED REPRESENTATIONS ARE TAKEN AS INPUT OF CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS (CNN) AND BIDIRECTIONAL LONG-TERM SHORT-TERM MEMORY NETWORKS (BILSTM) TO IDENTIFY RBP BINDING SITES. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT DEEPRKE OUTPERFORMS EXISTING COUNTERPART METHODS ON TWO LARGE-SCALE BENCHMARK DATASETS. CONCLUSIONS: OUR EXTENSIVE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS SHOW THAT DEEPRKE IS AN EFFICACIOUS TOOL FOR PREDICTING RBP BINDING SITES. THE DISTRIBUTED REPRESENTATIONS OF RNA SEQUENCES AND SECONDARY STRUCTURES CAN EFFECTIVELY DETECT THE LATENT RELATIONSHIP AND SIMILARITY BETWEEN K-MERS, AND THUS IMPROVE THE PREDICTIVE PERFORMANCE.

DEEP TRANSFORMERS AND CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK IN IDENTIFYING DNA N6-METHYLADENINE SITES IN CROSS-SPECIES GENOMES. AS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON POST-TRANSCRIPTIONAL EPIGENETIC MODIFICATIONS, N6-METHYLADENINE (6 MA), PLAYS AN ESSENTIAL ROLE IN VARIOUS CELLULAR PROCESSES AND DISEASE PATHOGENESIS. THEREFORE, ACCURATELY IDENTIFYING 6 MA MODIFICATIONS IS NECESSARY FOR A DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF CELLULAR PROCESSES AND OTHER POSSIBLE FUNCTIONAL MECHANISMS. ALTHOUGH A FEW COMPUTATIONAL METHODS HAVE BEEN PROPOSED, THEIR RESPECTIVE MODELS WERE DEVELOPED WITH SMALL TRAINING DATASETS. HENCE, THEIR PRACTICAL APPLICATION IS QUITE LIMITED IN GENOME-WIDE DETECTION. TO OVERCOME THE EXISTING LIMITATIONS, WE PRESENT A NOVEL MODEL BASED ON TRANSFORMER ARCHITECTURE AND DEEP LEARNING TO IDENTIFY DNA 6 MA SITES FROM THE CROSS-SPECIES GENOME. THE MODEL IS CONSTRUCTED ON A BENCHMARK DATASET AND EXPLORED A FEATURE DERIVED FROM PRE-TRAINED TRANSFORMER WORD EMBEDDING APPROACHES. SUBSEQUENTLY, A CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK WAS EMPLOYED TO LEARN THE GENERATED FEATURES AND GENERATE THE PREDICTION OUTCOMES. AS A RESULT, OUR PREDICTOR ACHIEVED EXCELLENT PERFORMANCE DURING INDEPENDENT TEST WITH THE ACCURACY AND MATTHEWS CORRELATION COEFFICIENT (MCC) OF 79.3% AND 0.58, RESPECTIVELY. OVERALL, ITS PERFORMANCE ACHIEVED BETTER ACCURACY THAN THE BASELINE MODELS AND SIGNIFICANTLY OUTPERFORMED THE EXISTING PREDICTORS, DEMONSTRATING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR PROPOSED HYBRID FRAMEWORK. FURTHERMORE, OUR MODEL IS EXPECTED TO ASSIST BIOLOGISTS IN ACCURATELY IDENTIFYING 6MAS AND FORMULATE THE NOVEL TESTABLE BIOLOGICAL HYPOTHESIS. WE ALSO RELEASE SOURCE CODES AND DATASETS FREELY AT HTTPS://GITHUB.COM/KHANHLEE/BERT-DNA FOR FRONT-END USERS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
DEEP-4MCW2V: A SEQUENCE-BASED PREDICTOR TO IDENTIFY N4-METHYLCYTOSINE SITES IN ESCHERICHIA COLI. N4-METHYLCYTOSINE (4MC) IS A TYPE OF DNA MODIFICATION WHICH COULD REGULATE SEVERAL BIOLOGICAL PROGRESSIONS SUCH AS TRANSCRIPTION REGULATION, REPLICATION AND GENE EXPRESSIONS. PRECISELY RECOGNIZING 4MC SITES IN GENOMIC SEQUENCES CAN PROVIDE SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THEIR GENETIC ROLES. THIS STUDY AIMED TO DEVELOP A DEEP LEARNING-BASED MODEL TO PREDICT 4MC SITES IN THE ESCHERICHIA COLI. IN THE MODEL, DNA SEQUENCES WERE ENCODED BY WORD EMBEDDING TECHNIQUE 'WORD2VEC'. THE OBTAINED FEATURES WERE INPUTTED INTO 1-D CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (CNN) TO DISCRIMINATE 4MC SITES FROM NON-4MC SITES IN ESCHERICHIA COLI GENOME. THE EXAMINATION ON INDEPENDENT DATASET SHOWED THAT OUR MODEL COULD YIELD THE OVERALL ACCURACY OF 0.861, WHICH WAS ABOUT 4.3% HIGHER THAN THE EXISTING MODEL. TO PROVIDE CONVENIENCE TO SCHOLARS, WE PROVIDED THE DATA AND SOURCE CODE OF THE MODEL WHICH CAN BE FREELY DOWNLOAD FROM HTTPS://GITHUB.COM/LINDING-GROUPS/DEEP-4MCW2V.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
DEEPADD: PROTEIN FUNCTION PREDICTION FROM K-MER EMBEDDING AND ADDITIONAL FEATURES. WITH THE APPLICATION OF NEW HIGH THROUGHPUT SEQUENCING TECHNOLOGY, A LARGE NUMBER OF PROTEIN SEQUENCES IS BECOMING AVAILABLE. DETERMINATION OF THE FUNCTIONAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THESE PROTEINS BY EXPERIMENTS IS AN EXPENSIVE ENDEAVOR THAT REQUIRES A LOT OF TIME. FURTHERMORE, AT THE ORGANISMAL LEVEL, SUCH KIND OF EXPERIMENTAL FUNCTIONAL ANALYSES CAN BE CONDUCTED ONLY FOR A VERY FEW SELECTED MODEL ORGANISMS. COMPUTATIONAL FUNCTION PREDICTION METHODS CAN BE USED TO FILL THIS GAP. THE FUNCTIONS OF PROTEINS ARE CLASSIFIED BY GENE ONTOLOGY (GO), WHICH CONTAINS MORE THAN 40,000 CLASSIFICATIONS IN THREE DOMAINS, MOLECULAR FUNCTION (MF), BIOLOGICAL PROCESS (BP), AND CELLULAR COMPONENT (CC). ADDITIONALLY, SINCE PROTEINS HAVE MANY FUNCTIONS, FUNCTION PREDICTION REPRESENTS A MULTI-LABEL AND MULTI-CLASS PROBLEM. WE DEVELOPED A NEW METHOD TO PREDICT PROTEIN FUNCTION FROM SEQUENCE. TO THIS END, NATURAL LANGUAGE MODEL WAS USED TO GENERATE WORD EMBEDDING OF SEQUENCE AND LEARN FEATURES FROM IT BY DEEP LEARNING, AND ADDITIONAL FEATURES TO LOCATE EVERY PROTEIN. OUR METHOD USES THE DEPENDENCIES BETWEEN GO CLASSES AS BACKGROUND INFORMATION TO CONSTRUCT A DEEP LEARNING MODEL. WE EVALUATE OUR METHOD USING THE STANDARDS ESTABLISHED BY THE COMPUTATIONAL ASSESSMENT OF FUNCTION ANNOTATION (CAFA) AND HAVE NOTICEABLE IMPROVEMENT OVER SEVERAL ALGORITHMS, SUCH AS FFPRED, DEEPGO, GOFDR AND OTHER METHODS COMPARED ON THE CAFA3 DATASETS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
DEEPCSO: A DEEP-LEARNING NETWORK APPROACH TO PREDICTING CYSTEINE S-SULPHENYLATION SITES. CYSTEINE S-SULPHENYLATION (CSO), AS A NOVEL POST-TRANSLATIONAL MODIFICATION (PTM), HAS EMERGED AS A POTENTIAL MECHANISM TO REGULATE PROTEIN FUNCTIONS AND AFFECT SIGNAL NETWORKS. BECAUSE OF ITS FUNCTIONAL SIGNIFICANCE, SEVERAL PREDICTION APPROACHES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED. NEVERTHELESS, THEY ARE BASED ON A LIMITED DATASET FROM HOMO SAPIENS AND THERE IS A LACK OF PREDICTION TOOLS FOR THE CSO SITES OF OTHER SPECIES. RECENTLY, THIS MODIFICATION HAS BEEN INVESTIGATED AT THE PROTEOMICS SCALE FOR A FEW SPECIES AND THE NUMBER OF IDENTIFIED CSO SITES HAS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED. THUS, IT IS ESSENTIAL TO EXPLORE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THIS MODIFICATION ACROSS DIFFERENT SPECIES AND CONSTRUCT PREDICTION MODELS WITH BETTER PERFORMANCES BASED ON THE ENLARGED DATASET. IN THIS STUDY, WE CONSTRUCTED SEVERAL CLASSIFIERS AND FOUND THAT THE LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY MODEL WITH THE WORD-EMBEDDING ENCODING APPROACH, DUBBED LSTM WE , PERFORMS FAVORABLY TO THE TRADITIONAL MACHINE-LEARNING MODELS AND OTHER DEEP-LEARNING MODELS ACROSS DIFFERENT SPECIES, IN TERMS OF CROSS-VALIDATION AND INDEPENDENT TEST. THE AREA UNDER THE RECEIVER OPERATING CHARACTERISTIC (ROC) CURVE FOR LSTM WE RANGED FROM 0.82 TO 0.85 FOR DIFFERENT ORGANISMS, WHICH WAS SUPERIOR TO THE REPORTED CSO PREDICTORS. MOREOVER, WE DEVELOPED THE GENERAL MODEL BASED ON THE INTEGRATED DATA FROM DIFFERENT SPECIES AND IT SHOWED GREAT UNIVERSALITY AND EFFECTIVENESS. WE PROVIDED THE ON-LINE PREDICTION SERVICE CALLED DEEPCSO THAT INCLUDED BOTH SPECIES-SPECIFIC AND GENERAL MODELS, WHICH IS ACCESSIBLE THROUGH HTTP://WWW.BIOINFOGO.ORG/DEEPCSO.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
DEEPIPS: COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT AND COMPUTATIONAL IDENTIFICATION OF PHOSPHORYLATION SITES OF SARS-COV-2 INFECTION USING A DEEP LEARNING-BASED APPROACH. THE RAPID SPREAD OF SARS-COV-2 INFECTION AROUND THE GLOBE HAS CAUSED A MASSIVE HEALTH AND SOCIOECONOMIC CRISIS. IDENTIFICATION OF PHOSPHORYLATION SITES IS AN IMPORTANT STEP FOR UNDERSTANDING THE MOLECULAR MECHANISMS OF SARS-COV-2 INFECTION AND THE CHANGES WITHIN THE HOST CELLS PATHWAYS. IN THIS STUDY, WE PRESENT DEEPIPS, A FIRST SPECIFIC DEEP-LEARNING ARCHITECTURE TO IDENTIFY PHOSPHORYLATION SITES IN HOST CELLS INFECTED WITH SARS-COV-2. DEEPIPS CONSISTS OF THE MOST POPULAR WORD EMBEDDING METHOD AND CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK-LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY NETWORK ARCHITECTURE TO MAKE THE FINAL PREDICTION. THE INDEPENDENT TEST DEMONSTRATES THAT DEEPIPS IMPROVES THE PREDICTION PERFORMANCE COMPARED WITH OTHER EXISTING TOOLS FOR GENERAL PHOSPHORYLATION SITES PREDICTION. BASED ON THE PROPOSED MODEL, A WEB-SERVER CALLED DEEPIPS WAS ESTABLISHED AND IS FREELY ACCESSIBLE AT HTTP://LIN-GROUP.CN/SERVER/DEEPIPS. THE SOURCE CODE OF DEEPIPS IS FREELY AVAILABLE AT THE REPOSITORY HTTPS://GITHUB.COM/LINDING-GROUP/DEEPIPS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
DEEPM5C: A DEEP-LEARNING-BASED HYBRID FRAMEWORK FOR IDENTIFYING HUMAN RNA N5-METHYLCYTOSINE SITES USING A STACKING STRATEGY. AS ONE OF THE MOST PREVALENT POST-TRANSCRIPTIONAL EPIGENETIC MODIFICATIONS, N5-METHYLCYTOSINE (M5C) PLAYS AN ESSENTIAL ROLE IN VARIOUS CELLULAR PROCESSES AND DISEASE PATHOGENESIS. THEREFORE, IT IS IMPORTANT ACCURATELY IDENTIFY M5C MODIFICATIONS IN ORDER TO GAIN A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF CELLULAR PROCESSES AND OTHER POSSIBLE FUNCTIONAL MECHANISMS. ALTHOUGH A FEW COMPUTATIONAL METHODS HAVE BEEN PROPOSED, THEIR RESPECTIVE MODELS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED USING SMALL TRAINING DATASETS. HENCE, THEIR PRACTICAL APPLICATION IS QUITE LIMITED IN GENOME-WIDE DETECTION. TO OVERCOME THE EXISTING LIMITATIONS, WE PROPOSE DEEPM5C, A BIOINFORMATICS METHOD FOR IDENTIFYING RNA M5C SITES THROUGHOUT THE HUMAN GENOME. TO DEVELOP DEEPM5C, WE CONSTRUCTED A NOVEL BENCHMARKING DATASET AND INVESTIGATED A MIXTURE OF THREE CONVENTIONAL FEATURE-ENCODING ALGORITHMS AND A FEATURE DERIVED FROM WORD-EMBEDDING APPROACHES. AFTERWARD, FOUR VARIANTS OF DEEP-LEARNING CLASSIFIERS AND FOUR COMMONLY USED CONVENTIONAL CLASSIFIERS WERE EMPLOYED AND TRAINED WITH THE FOUR ENCODINGS, ULTIMATELY OBTAINING 32 BASELINE MODELS. A STACKING STRATEGY IS EFFECTIVELY UTILIZED BY INTEGRATING THE PREDICTED OUTPUT OF THE OPTIMAL BASELINE MODELS AND TRAINED WITH A ONE-DIMENSIONAL (1D) CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK. AS A RESULT, THE DEEPM5C PREDICTOR ACHIEVED EXCELLENT PERFORMANCE DURING CROSS-VALIDATION WITH A MATTHEWS CORRELATION COEFFICIENT AND AN ACCURACY OF 0.697 AND 0.855, RESPECTIVELY. THE CORRESPONDING METRICS DURING THE INDEPENDENT TEST WERE 0.691 AND 0.852, RESPECTIVELY. OVERALL, DEEPM5C ACHIEVED A MORE ACCURATE AND STABLE PERFORMANCE THAN THE BASELINE MODELS AND SIGNIFICANTLY OUTPERFORMED THE EXISTING PREDICTORS, DEMONSTRATING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR PROPOSED HYBRID FRAMEWORK. FURTHERMORE, DEEPM5C IS EXPECTED TO ASSIST COMMUNITY-WIDE EFFORTS IN IDENTIFYING PUTATIVE M5CS AND TO FORMULATE THE NOVEL TESTABLE BIOLOGICAL HYPOTHESIS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
DEEPMHADTA: PREDICTION OF DRUG-TARGET BINDING AFFINITY USING MULTI-HEAD SELF-ATTENTION AND CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK. DRUG-TARGET INTERACTIONS PROVIDE INSIGHT INTO THE DRUG-SIDE EFFECTS AND DRUG REPOSITIONING. HOWEVER, WET-LAB BIOCHEMICAL EXPERIMENTS ARE TIME-CONSUMING AND LABOR-INTENSIVE, AND ARE INSUFFICIENT TO MEET THE PRESSING DEMAND FOR DRUG RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. WITH THE RAPID ADVANCEMENT OF DEEP LEARNING, COMPUTATIONAL METHODS ARE INCREASINGLY APPLIED TO SCREEN DRUG-TARGET INTERACTIONS. MANY METHODS CONSIDER THIS PROBLEM AS A BINARY CLASSIFICATION TASK (BINDING OR NOT), BUT IGNORE THE QUANTITATIVE BINDING AFFINITY. IN THIS PAPER, WE PROPOSE A NEW END-TO-END DEEP LEARNING METHOD CALLED DEEPMHADTA, WHICH USES THE MULTI-HEAD SELF-ATTENTION MECHANISM IN A DEEP RESIDUAL NETWORK TO PREDICT DRUG-TARGET BINDING AFFINITY. ON TWO BENCHMARK DATASETS, OUR METHOD OUTPERFORMED SEVERAL CURRENT STATE-OF-THE-ART METHODS IN TERMS OF MULTIPLE PERFORMANCE MEASURES, INCLUDING MEAN SQUARE ERROR (MSE), CONSISTENCY INDEX (CI), RM2, AND PR CURVE AREA (AUPR). THE RESULTS DEMONSTRATED THAT OUR METHOD ACHIEVED BETTER PERFORMANCE IN PREDICTING THE DRUG-TARGET BINDING AFFINITY.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
DEEPSADPR: A HYBRID-LEARNING ARCHITECTURE FOR SERINE ADP-RIBOSYLATION SITE PREDICTION. PROTEIN ADENOSINE DIPHOSPHATE-RIBOSYLATION (ADPR) IS CAUSED BY THE COVALENT BINDING OF ONE OR MORE ADP-RIBOSE MOIETIES TO A TARGET PROTEIN AND REGULATES THE BIOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS OF THE TARGET PROTEIN. TO FULLY UNDERSTAND THE REGULATORY MECHANISM OF ADP-RIBOSYLATION, THE ESSENTIAL STEP IS THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE ADPR SITES FROM THE PROTEOME. AS THE EXPERIMENTAL APPROACHES ARE COSTLY AND TIME-CONSUMING, IT IS NECESSARY TO DEVELOP A COMPUTATIONAL TOOL TO PREDICT ADPR SITES. RECENTLY, SERINE HAS BEEN FOUND TO BE THE MAJOR RESIDUE TYPE FOR ADP-RIBOSYLATION BUT NO PREDICTOR IS AVAILABLE. IN THIS STUDY, WE COLLECTED THOUSANDS OF EXPERIMENTALLY VALIDATED HUMAN ADPR SITES ON SERINE RESIDUE AND CONSTRUCTED SEVERAL DIFFERENT MACHINE-LEARNING CLASSIFIERS. WE FOUND THAT THE HYBRID MODEL, DUBBED DEEPSADPR, WHICH INTEGRATED THE ONE-DIMENSIONAL CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (CNN) WITH THE ONE-HOT ENCODING APPROACH AND THE WORD-EMBEDDING APPROACH, COMPARED FAVOURABLY TO OTHER MODELS IN TERMS OF BOTH TEN-FOLD CROSS-VALIDATION AND INDEPENDENT TEST. ITS AUC VALUES REACHED 0.935 FOR TEN-FOLD CROSS-VALIDATION. ITS VALUES OF SENSITIVITY, ACCURACY AND MATTHEWS'S CORRELATION COEFFICIENT REACHED 0.933, 0.867 AND 0.740, RESPECTIVELY, WITH THE FIXED SPECIFICITY VALUE OF 0.80. OVERALL, DEEPSADPR IS THE FIRST CLASSIFIER FOR PREDICTING SERINE ADPR SITES, WHICH IS AVAILABLE AT HTTP://WWW.BIOINFOGO.ORG/DEEPSADPR.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
DEIDNER MODEL: A NEURAL NETWORK NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION MODEL FOR USE IN THE DE-IDENTIFICATION OF CLINICAL NOTES. CLINICAL NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION (NER) IS AN ESSENTIAL BUILDING BLOCK FOR MANY DOWNSTREAM NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) APPLICATIONS SUCH AS INFORMATION EXTRACTION AND DE-IDENTIFICATION. RECENTLY, DEEP LEARNING (DL) METHODS THAT UTILIZE WORD EMBEDDINGS HAVE BECOME POPULAR IN CLINICAL NLP TASKS. HOWEVER, THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE WORK ON EVALUATING AND COMBINING THE WORD EMBEDDINGS TRAINED FROM DIFFERENT DOMAINS. THE GOAL OF THIS STUDY IS TO IMPROVE THE PERFORMANCE OF NER IN CLINICAL DISCHARGE SUMMARIES BY DEVELOPING A DL MODEL THAT COMBINES DIFFERENT EMBEDDINGS AND INVESTIGATE THE COMBINATION OF STANDARD AND CONTEXTUAL EMBEDDINGS FROM THE GENERAL AND CLINICAL DOMAINS. WE DEVELOPED: 1) A HUMAN-ANNOTATED HIGH-QUALITY INTERNAL CORPUS WITH DISCHARGE SUMMARIES AND 2) A NER MODEL WITH AN INPUT EMBEDDING LAYER THAT COMBINES DIFFERENT EMBEDDINGS: STANDARD WORD EMBEDDINGS, CONTEXT-BASED WORD EMBEDDINGS, A CHARACTER-LEVEL WORD EMBEDDING USING A CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (CNN), AND AN EXTERNAL KNOWLEDGE SOURCES ALONG WITH WORD FEATURES AS ONE-HOT VECTORS. EMBEDDING WAS FOLLOWED BY BIDIRECTIONAL LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY (BI-LSTM) AND CONDITIONAL RANDOM FIELD (CRF) LAYERS. THE PROPOSED MODEL REACHES OR OVERCOMES STATE-OF-THE-ART PERFORMANCE ON TWO PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATA SETS AND AN F1 SCORE OF 94.31% ON AN INTERNAL CORPUS. AFTER INCORPORATING MIXED-DOMAIN CLINICALLY PRE-TRAINED CONTEXTUAL EMBEDDINGS, THE F1 SCORE FURTHER IMPROVED TO 95.36% ON THE INTERNAL CORPUS. THIS STUDY DEMONSTRATED AN EFFICIENT WAY OF COMBINING DIFFERENT EMBEDDINGS THAT WILL IMPROVE THE RECOGNITION PERFORMANCE AIDING THE DOWNSTREAM DE-IDENTIFICATION OF CLINICAL NOTES.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
DELFOS: DEEP LEARNING MODEL FOR PREDICTION OF SOLVATION FREE ENERGIES IN GENERIC ORGANIC SOLVENTS. PREDICTION OF AQUEOUS SOLUBILITIES OR HYDRATION FREE ENERGIES IS AN EXTENSIVELY STUDIED AREA IN MACHINE LEARNING APPLICATIONS IN CHEMISTRY SINCE WATER IS THE SOLE SOLVENT IN THE LIVING SYSTEM. HOWEVER, FOR NON-AQUEOUS SOLUTIONS, FEW MACHINE LEARNING STUDIES HAVE BEEN UNDERTAKEN SO FAR DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE SOLVATION MECHANISM PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN VARIOUS CHEMICAL REACTIONS. HERE, WE INTRODUCE DELFOS (DEEP LEARNING MODEL FOR SOLVATION FREE ENERGIES IN GENERIC ORGANIC SOLVENTS), WHICH IS A NOVEL, MACHINE-LEARNING-BASED QSPR METHOD WHICH PREDICTS SOLVATION FREE ENERGIES FOR VARIOUS ORGANIC SOLUTE AND SOLVENT SYSTEMS. A NOVELTY OF DELFOS INVOLVES TWO SEPARATE SOLVENT AND SOLUTE ENCODER NETWORKS THAT CAN QUANTIFY STRUCTURAL FEATURES OF GIVEN COMPOUNDS VIA WORD EMBEDDING AND RECURRENT LAYERS, AUGMENTED WITH THE ATTENTION MECHANISM WHICH EXTRACTS IMPORTANT SUBSTRUCTURES FROM OUTPUTS OF RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORKS. AS A RESULT, THE PREDICTOR NETWORK CALCULATES THE SOLVATION FREE ENERGY OF A GIVEN SOLVENT-SOLUTE PAIR USING FEATURES FROM ENCODERS. WITH THE RESULTS OBTAINED FROM EXTENSIVE CALCULATIONS USING 2495 SOLUTE-SOLVENT PAIRS, WE DEMONSTRATE THAT DELFOS NOT ONLY HAS GREAT POTENTIAL IN SHOWING ACCURACY COMPARABLE TO THAT OF THE STATE-OF-THE-ART COMPUTATIONAL CHEMISTRY METHODS, BUT ALSO OFFERS INFORMATION ABOUT WHICH SUBSTRUCTURES PLAY A DOMINANT ROLE IN THE SOLVATION PROCESS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
DETECTING ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS ON TWITTER WITH CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS AND WORD EMBEDDING FEATURES. MOTIVATED BY LIMITATIONS OF ADVERSE DRUG REACTION (ADR) DETECTION IN CLINICAL TRIALS AND PASSIVE POST-MARKET DRUG SAFETY SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS, A NUMBER OF RESEARCHERS HAVE EXAMINED SOCIAL MEDIA DATA AS A POTENTIAL ADR INFORMATION SOURCE. TWITTER IS A PARTICULARLY ATTRACTIVE PLATFORM BECAUSE IT HAS A LARGE, DIVERSE USER COMMUNITY. TWO CHALLENGES FACED IN APPLYING TWITTER DATA ARE THAT ADR DESCRIPTIONS ARE INFREQUENT RELATIVE TO THE OVERALL NUMBER OF USER POSTS AND HUMAN REVIEW OF ALL POSTS IS IMPRACTICAL. TO ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES, WE FRAMED THE ADR DETECTION PROBLEM AS A BINARY CLASSIFICATION TASK, WHERE OUR OBJECTIVE WAS TO DEVELOP A COMPUTATIONAL METHOD THAT CAN CLASSIFY USER POSTS, KNOWN AS TWEETS, RELATIVE TO THE PRESENCE OF AN ADR DESCRIPTION. WE DEVELOPED A CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK MODEL (CONVNET) THAT PROCESSES TWEETS AS REPRESENTED BY WORD VECTORS CREATED USING UNSUPERVISED LEARNING ON LARGE DATASETS. THE CONVNET MODEL ACHIEVED AN F1-SCORE OF 0.46 AND SENSITIVITY OF 0.78 FOR TWEET ADR CLASSIFICATION ON THE TEST DATASET, COMPARED TO 0.37 F1-SCORE AND 0.33 SENSITIVITY OBTAINED BY TWO BASELINE SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE (SVM) MODELS THAT INCORPORATED WORD EMBEDDING, N-GRAM, AND LEXICON FEATURES. WE ATTRIBUTE THE SUPERIOR CONVNET MODEL PERFORMANCE TO ITS ABILITY TO PROCESS ARBITRARY LENGTH INPUTS, WHICH ALLOWS IT TO EVALUATE EVERY WORD EMBEDDING IN A GIVEN TWEET AND MAKE BETTER USE OF THEIR SEMANTIC CONTENT AS COMPARED TO THE SVM MODELS WHICH REQUIRE A FIXED LENGTH, AGGREGATED EMBEDDING INPUT. THE RESULTS PRESENTED DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF DETECTION OF INFREQUENT ADR MENTIONS IN LARGE-SCALE MEDIA DATA.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
DETECTING AND ANALYZING SUICIDAL IDEATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA USING DEEP LEARNING AND MACHINE LEARNING MODELS. INDIVIDUALS WHO SUFFER FROM SUICIDAL IDEATION FREQUENTLY EXPRESS THEIR VIEWS AND IDEAS ON SOCIAL MEDIA. THUS, SEVERAL STUDIES FOUND THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE CONTEMPLATING SUICIDE CAN BE IDENTIFIED BY ANALYZING SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS. HOWEVER, FINDING AND COMPREHENDING PATTERNS OF SUICIDAL IDEATION REPRESENT A CHALLENGING TASK. THEREFORE, IT IS ESSENTIAL TO DEVELOP A MACHINE LEARNING SYSTEM FOR AUTOMATED EARLY DETECTION OF SUICIDAL IDEATION OR ANY ABRUPT CHANGES IN A USER'S BEHAVIOR BY ANALYZING HIS OR HER POSTS ON SOCIAL MEDIA. IN THIS PAPER, WE PROPOSE A METHODOLOGY BASED ON EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH FOR BUILDING A SUICIDAL IDEATION DETECTION SYSTEM USING PUBLICLY AVAILABLE REDDIT DATASETS, WORD-EMBEDDING APPROACHES, SUCH AS TF-IDF AND WORD2VEC, FOR TEXT REPRESENTATION, AND HYBRID DEEP LEARNING AND MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS FOR CLASSIFICATION. A CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK AND BIDIRECTIONAL LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY (CNN-BILSTM) MODEL AND THE MACHINE LEARNING XGBOOST MODEL WERE USED TO CLASSIFY SOCIAL POSTS AS SUICIDAL OR NON-SUICIDAL USING TEXTUAL AND LIWC-22-BASED FEATURES BY CONDUCTING TWO EXPERIMENTS. TO ASSESS THE MODELS' PERFORMANCE, WE USED THE STANDARD METRICS OF ACCURACY, PRECISION, RECALL, AND F1-SCORES. A COMPARISON OF THE TEST RESULTS SHOWED THAT WHEN USING TEXTUAL FEATURES, THE CNN-BILSTM MODEL OUTPERFORMED THE XGBOOST MODEL, ACHIEVING 95% SUICIDAL IDEATION DETECTION ACCURACY, COMPARED WITH THE LATTER'S 91.5% ACCURACY. CONVERSELY, WHEN USING LIWC FEATURES, XGBOOST SHOWED BETTER PERFORMANCE THAN CNN-BILSTM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
DETECTING DEPRESSION SIGNS ON SOCIAL MEDIA: A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW. AMONG MENTAL HEALTH DISEASES, DEPRESSION IS ONE OF THE MOST SEVERE, AS IT OFTEN LEADS TO SUICIDE; DUE TO THIS, IT IS IMPORTANT TO IDENTIFY AND SUMMARIZE EXISTING EVIDENCE CONCERNING DEPRESSION SIGN DETECTION RESEARCH ON SOCIAL MEDIA USING THE DATA PROVIDED BY USERS. THIS REVIEW EXAMINES ASPECTS OF PRIMARY STUDIES EXPLORING DEPRESSION DETECTION FROM SOCIAL MEDIA SUBMISSIONS (FROM 2016 TO MID-2021). THE SEARCH FOR PRIMARY STUDIES WAS CONDUCTED IN FIVE DIGITAL LIBRARIES: ACM DIGITAL LIBRARY, IEEE XPLORE DIGITAL LIBRARY, SPRINGERLINK, SCIENCE DIRECT, AND PUBMED, AS WELL AS ON THE SEARCH ENGINE GOOGLE SCHOLAR TO BROADEN THE RESULTS. EXTRACTING AND SYNTHESIZING THE DATA FROM EACH PAPER WAS THE MAIN ACTIVITY OF THIS WORK. THIRTY-FOUR PRIMARY STUDIES WERE ANALYZED AND EVALUATED. TWITTER WAS THE MOST STUDIED SOCIAL MEDIA FOR DEPRESSION SIGN DETECTION. WORD EMBEDDING WAS THE MOST PROMINENT LINGUISTIC FEATURE EXTRACTION METHOD. SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE (SVM) WAS THE MOST USED MACHINE-LEARNING ALGORITHM. SIMILARLY, THE MOST POPULAR COMPUTING TOOL WAS FROM PYTHON LIBRARIES. FINALLY, CROSS-VALIDATION (CV) WAS THE MOST COMMON STATISTICAL ANALYSIS METHOD USED TO EVALUATE THE RESULTS OBTAINED. USING SOCIAL MEDIA ALONG WITH COMPUTING TOOLS AND CLASSIFICATION METHODS CONTRIBUTES TO CURRENT EFFORTS IN PUBLIC HEALTHCARE TO DETECT SIGNS OF DEPRESSION FROM SOURCES CLOSE TO PATIENTS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
DETECTING NEGATION AND SCOPE IN CHINESE CLINICAL NOTES USING CHARACTER AND WORD EMBEDDING. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: RESEARCHERS HAVE DEVELOPED EFFECTIVE METHODS TO INDEX FREE-TEXT CLINICAL NOTES INTO STRUCTURED DATABASE, IN WHICH NEGATION DETECTION IS A CRITICAL BUT CHALLENGING STEP. IN CHINESE CLINICAL RECORDS, NEGATION DETECTION IS PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING BECAUSE IT MAY DEPEND ON UPSTREAM CHINESE INFORMATION PROCESSING COMPONENTS SUCH AS WORD SEGMENTATION [1]. TRADITIONALLY, NEGATION DETECTION WAS CARRIED OUT MOSTLY USING RULE-BASED METHODS, WHOSE COMPREHENSIVENESS AND PORTABILITY WERE USUALLY LIMITED. OUR OBJECTIVES IN THIS PAPER ARE TO: 1) CONSTRUCT A LARGE CHINESE CLINICAL NOTES CORPUS WITH NEGATION ANNOTATED; 2) DEVELOP A NEGATION DETECTION TOOL FOR CHINESE CLINICAL NOTES; 3) EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE OF CHARACTER AND WORD EMBEDDING FEATURES IN CHINESE CLINICAL NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING. METHODS: IN THIS PAPER, WE CONSTRUCT A CHINESE CLINICAL CORPUS CONSISTING OF ADMISSION AND DISCHARGE SUMMARIES, AND PROPOSE SEQUENCE LABELING BASED SYSTEMS FOR NEGATION AND SCOPE DETECTION. OUR SYSTEMS RELY ON FEATURES FROM BAG OF CHARACTERS, BAG OF WORDS, CHARACTER EMBEDDING AND WORD EMBEDDING. FOR SCOPES, WE INTRODUCE AN ADDITIONAL FEATURE TO HANDLE NESTED SCOPES WITH MULTIPLE NEGATIONS. RESULTS: THE TWO ANNOTATORS REACHED AN AGREEMENT OF 0.79 MEASURED BY KAPPA IN MANUAL ANNOTATION. IN CUE DETECTION, OUR SYSTEMS ARE ABLE TO ACHIEVE A PERFORMANCE AS HIGH AS 99.0% MEASURED BY F SCORE, WHICH SIGNIFICANTLY OUTPERFORM ITS RULE-BASED COUNTERPART (79% F). THE BEST SYSTEM USES WORD EMBEDDING AS FEATURES, WHICH YIELDS PRECISION OF 99.0% AND RECALL OF 99.1%. IN SCOPE DETECTION, OUR SYSTEM IS ABLE TO ACHIEVE A PERFORMANCE OF 94.6% MEASURED BY F SCORE. CONCLUSIONS: OUR STUDY PROVIDES A STATE-OF-THE-ART NEGATION-DETECTING TOOL FOR CHINESE CLINICAL FREE-TEXT NOTES; EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT WORD EMBEDDING IS EFFECTIVE IN IDENTIFYING NEGATIONS, AND THAT NESTED SCOPES CAN BE IDENTIFIED EFFECTIVELY BY OUR METHOD.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
DETECTING POTENTIAL ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS USING A DEEP NEURAL NETWORK MODEL. BACKGROUND: ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS (ADRS) ARE COMMON AND ARE THE UNDERLYING CAUSE OF OVER A MILLION SERIOUS INJURIES AND DEATHS EACH YEAR. THE MOST FAMILIAR METHOD TO DETECT ADRS IS RELYING ON SPONTANEOUS REPORTS. UNFORTUNATELY, THE LOW REPORTING RATE OF SPONTANEOUS REPORTS IS A SERIOUS LIMITATION OF PHARMACOVIGILANCE. OBJECTIVE: THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO IDENTIFY A METHOD TO DETECT POTENTIAL ADRS OF DRUGS AUTOMATICALLY USING A DEEP NEURAL NETWORK (DNN). METHODS: WE DESIGNED A DNN MODEL THAT UTILIZES THE CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, AND BIOMEDICAL INFORMATION OF DRUGS TO DETECT ADRS. THIS MODEL AIMED TO FULFILL TWO MAIN PURPOSES: IDENTIFYING THE POTENTIAL ADRS OF DRUGS AND PREDICTING THE POSSIBLE ADRS OF A NEW DRUG. FOR IMPROVING THE DETECTION PERFORMANCE, WE DISTRIBUTED REPRESENTATIONS OF THE TARGET DRUGS IN A VECTOR SPACE TO CAPTURE THE DRUG RELATIONSHIPS USING THE WORD-EMBEDDING APPROACH TO PROCESS SUBSTANTIAL BIOMEDICAL LITERATURE. MOREOVER, WE BUILT A MAPPING FUNCTION TO ADDRESS NEW DRUGS THAT DO NOT APPEAR IN THE DATASET. RESULTS: USING THE DRUG INFORMATION AND THE ADRS REPORTED UP TO 2009, WE PREDICTED THE ADRS OF DRUGS RECORDED UP TO 2012. THERE WERE 746 DRUGS AND 232 NEW DRUGS, WHICH WERE ONLY RECORDED IN 2012 WITH 1325 ADRS. THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE OVERALL PERFORMANCE OF OUR MODEL WITH MEAN AVERAGE PRECISION AT TOP-10 ACHIEVED IS 0.523 AND THE REA UNDER THE RECEIVER OPERATING CHARACTERISTIC CURVE (AUC) SCORE ACHIEVED IS 0.844 FOR ADR PREDICTION ON THE DATASET. CONCLUSIONS: OUR MODEL IS EFFECTIVE IN IDENTIFYING THE POTENTIAL ADRS OF A DRUG AND THE POSSIBLE ADRS OF A NEW DRUG. MOST IMPORTANTLY, IT CAN DETECT POTENTIAL ADRS IRRESPECTIVE OF WHETHER THEY HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN THE PAST.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
DEVELOPMENT OF A CONSUMER HEALTH VOCABULARY BY MINING HEALTH FORUM TEXTS BASED ON WORD EMBEDDING: SEMIAUTOMATIC APPROACH. BACKGROUND: THE VOCABULARY GAP BETWEEN CONSUMERS AND PROFESSIONALS IN THE MEDICAL DOMAIN HINDERS INFORMATION SEEKING AND COMMUNICATION. CONSUMER HEALTH VOCABULARIES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED TO AID SUCH INFORMATICS APPLICATIONS. THIS PURPOSE IS BEST SERVED IF THE VOCABULARY EVOLVES WITH CONSUMERS' LANGUAGE. OBJECTIVE: OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO DEVELOP A METHOD FOR IDENTIFYING AND ADDING NEW TERMS TO CONSUMER HEALTH VOCABULARIES, SO THAT IT CAN KEEP UP WITH THE CONSTANTLY EVOLVING MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE AND LANGUAGE USE. METHODS: IN THIS PAPER, WE PROPOSE A CONSUMER HEALTH TERM-FINDING FRAMEWORK BASED ON A DISTRIBUTED WORD VECTOR SPACE MODEL. WE FIRST LEARNED WORD VECTORS FROM A LARGE-SCALE TEXT CORPUS AND THEN ADOPTED A SUPERVISED METHOD WITH EXISTING CONSUMER HEALTH VOCABULARIES FOR LEARNING VECTOR REPRESENTATION OF WORDS, WHICH CAN PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SUPERVISED FINE TUNING AFTER UNSUPERVISED WORD EMBEDDING LEARNING. WITH A FINE-TUNED WORD VECTOR SPACE, WE IDENTIFIED PAIRS OF PROFESSIONAL TERMS AND THEIR CONSUMER VARIANTS BY THEIR SEMANTIC DISTANCE IN THE VECTOR SPACE. A SUBSEQUENT MANUAL REVIEW OF THE EXTRACTED AND LABELED PAIRS OF ENTITIES WAS CONDUCTED TO VALIDATE THE RESULTS GENERATED BY THE PROPOSED APPROACH. THE RESULTS WERE EVALUATED USING MEAN RECIPROCAL RANK (MRR). RESULTS: MANUAL EVALUATION SHOWED THAT IT IS FEASIBLE TO IDENTIFY ALTERNATIVE MEDICAL CONCEPTS BY USING PROFESSIONAL OR CONSUMER CONCEPTS AS QUERIES IN THE WORD VECTOR SPACE WITHOUT FINE TUNING, BUT THE RESULTS ARE MORE PROMISING IN THE FINAL FINE-TUNED WORD VECTOR SPACE. THE MRR VALUES INDICATED THAT ON AN AVERAGE, A PROFESSIONAL OR CONSUMER CONCEPT IS ABOUT 14TH CLOSEST TO ITS COUNTERPART IN THE WORD VECTOR SPACE WITHOUT FINE TUNING, AND THE MRR IN THE FINAL FINE-TUNED WORD VECTOR SPACE IS 8. FURTHERMORE, THE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT OUR METHOD CAN COLLECT ABBREVIATIONS AND COMMON TYPOS FREQUENTLY USED BY CONSUMERS. CONCLUSIONS: BY INTEGRATING A LARGE AMOUNT OF TEXT INFORMATION AND EXISTING CONSUMER HEALTH VOCABULARIES, OUR METHOD OUTPERFORMED SEVERAL BASELINE RANKING METHODS AND IS EFFECTIVE FOR GENERATING A LIST OF CANDIDATE TERMS FOR HUMAN REVIEW DURING CONSUMER HEALTH VOCABULARY DEVELOPMENT.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
DEVELOPMENT OF A LEXICON FOR PAIN. PAIN HAS BEEN AN AREA OF GROWING INTEREST IN THE PAST DECADE AND IS KNOWN TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. DUE TO THE AMBIGUOUS NATURE OF HOW PAIN IS DESCRIBED IN TEXT, IT PRESENTS A UNIQUE NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) CHALLENGE. UNDERSTANDING HOW PAIN IS DESCRIBED IN TEXT AND UTILIZING THIS KNOWLEDGE TO IMPROVE NLP TASKS WOULD BE OF SUBSTANTIAL CLINICAL IMPORTANCE. NOT MUCH WORK HAS PREVIOUSLY BEEN DONE IN THIS SPACE. FOR THIS REASON, AND IN ORDER TO DEVELOP AN ENGLISH LEXICON FOR USE IN NLP APPLICATIONS, AN EXPLORATION OF PAIN CONCEPTS WITHIN FREE TEXT WAS CONDUCTED. THE EXPLORATORY TEXT SOURCES INCLUDED TWO HOSPITAL DATABASES, A SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM (TWITTER), AND AN ONLINE COMMUNITY (REDDIT). THIS EXPLORATION HELPED SELECT APPROPRIATE SOURCES AND INFORM THE CONSTRUCTION OF A PAIN LEXICON. THE TERMS WITHIN THE FINAL LEXICON WERE DERIVED FROM THREE SOURCES-LITERATURE, ONTOLOGIES, AND WORD EMBEDDING MODELS. THIS LEXICON WAS VALIDATED BY TWO CLINICIANS AS WELL AS COMPARED TO AN EXISTING 26-TERM PAIN SUB-ONTOLOGY AND MESH (MEDICAL SUBJECT HEADINGS) TERMS. THE FINAL VALIDATED LEXICON CONSISTS OF 382 TERMS AND WILL BE USED IN DOWNSTREAM NLP TASKS BY HELPING SELECT APPROPRIATE PAIN-RELATED DOCUMENTS FROM ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD (EHR) DATABASES, AS WELL AS PRE-ANNOTATING THESE WORDS TO HELP IN DEVELOPMENT OF AN NLP APPLICATION FOR CLASSIFICATION OF MENTIONS OF PAIN WITHIN THE DOCUMENTS. THE LEXICON AND THE CODE USED TO GENERATE THE EMBEDDING MODELS HAVE BEEN MADE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
DEVELOPMENT OF A PIPELINE FOR ADVERSE DRUG REACTION IDENTIFICATION IN CLINICAL NOTES: WORD EMBEDDING MODELS AND STRING MATCHING. BACKGROUND: KNOWLEDGE ABOUT ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS (ADRS) IN THE POPULATION IS LIMITED BECAUSE OF UNDERREPORTING, WHICH HAMPERS SURVEILLANCE AND ASSESSMENT OF DRUG SAFETY. THEREFORE, GATHERING ACCURATE INFORMATION THAT CAN BE RETRIEVED FROM CLINICAL NOTES ABOUT THE INCIDENCE OF ADRS IS OF GREAT RELEVANCE. HOWEVER, MANUAL LABELING OF THESE NOTES IS TIME-CONSUMING, AND AUTOMATIZATION CAN IMPROVE THE USE OF FREE-TEXT CLINICAL NOTES FOR THE IDENTIFICATION OF ADRS. FURTHERMORE, TOOLS FOR LANGUAGE PROCESSING IN LANGUAGES OTHER THAN ENGLISH ARE NOT WIDELY AVAILABLE. OBJECTIVE: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO DESIGN AND EVALUATE A METHOD FOR AUTOMATIC EXTRACTION OF MEDICATION AND ADVERSE DRUG REACTION IDENTIFICATION IN CLINICAL NOTES (ADRIN). METHODS: DUTCH FREE-TEXT CLINICAL NOTES (N=277,398) AND MEDICATION REGISTRATIONS (N=499,435) FROM THE CARDIOLOGY CENTERS OF THE NETHERLANDS DATABASE WERE USED. ALL CLINICAL NOTES WERE USED TO DEVELOP WORD EMBEDDING MODELS. VECTOR REPRESENTATIONS OF WORD EMBEDDING MODELS AND STRING MATCHING WITH A MEDICAL DICTIONARY (MEDICAL DICTIONARY FOR REGULATORY ACTIVITIES [MEDDRA]) WERE USED FOR IDENTIFICATION OF ADRS AND MEDICATION IN A TEST SET OF CLINICAL NOTES THAT WERE MANUALLY LABELED. SEVERAL SETTINGS, INCLUDING SEARCH AREA AND PUNCTUATION, COULD BE ADJUSTED IN THE PROTOTYPE TO EVALUATE THE OPTIMAL VERSION OF THE PROTOTYPE. RESULTS: THE ADRIN METHOD WAS EVALUATED USING A TEST SET OF 988 CLINICAL NOTES WRITTEN ON THE STOP DATE OF A DRUG. MULTIPLE VERSIONS OF THE PROTOTYPE WERE EVALUATED FOR A VARIETY OF TASKS. BINARY CLASSIFICATION OF ADR PRESENCE ACHIEVED THE HIGHEST ACCURACY OF 0.84. REDUCED SEARCH AREA AND INCLUSION OF PUNCTUATION IMPROVED PERFORMANCE, WHEREAS INCORPORATION OF THE MEDDRA DID NOT IMPROVE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE PIPELINE. CONCLUSIONS: THE ADRIN METHOD AND PROTOTYPE ARE EFFECTIVE IN RECOGNIZING ADRS IN DUTCH CLINICAL NOTES FROM CARDIAC DIAGNOSTIC SCREENING CENTERS. SURPRISINGLY, INCORPORATION OF THE MEDDRA DID NOT RESULT IN IMPROVED IDENTIFICATION ON TOP OF WORD EMBEDDING MODELS. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ADRIN TOOL MAY HELP INCREASE THE IDENTIFICATION OF ADRS, RESULTING IN BETTER CARE AND SAVING SUBSTANTIAL HEALTH CARE COSTS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
DEVELOPMENT OF AN AUTOMATED PHENOTYPING ALGORITHM FOR HEPATORENAL SYNDROME. OBJECTIVE: HEPATORENAL SYNDROME (HRS) IS A DEVASTATING FORM OF ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY (AKI) IN ADVANCED LIVER DISEASE PATIENTS WITH HIGH MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY, BUT PHENOTYPING ALGORITHMS HAVE NOT YET BEEN DEVELOPED USING LARGE ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD (EHR) DATABASES. WE EVALUATED AND COMPARED MULTIPLE PHENOTYPING METHODS TO ACHIEVE AN ACCURATE ALGORITHM FOR HRS IDENTIFICATION. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A NATIONAL RETROSPECTIVE COHORT OF PATIENTS WITH CIRRHOSIS AND AKI ADMITTED TO 124 VETERANS AFFAIRS HOSPITALS WAS ASSEMBLED FROM ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD DATA COLLECTED FROM 2005 TO 2013. AKI WAS DEFINED BY THE KIDNEY DISEASE: IMPROVING GLOBAL OUTCOMES CRITERIA. FIVE HUNDRED AND FOUR HOSPITALIZATIONS WERE SELECTED FOR MANUAL CHART REVIEW AND SERVED AS THE GOLD STANDARD. ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD BASED PREDICTORS WERE IDENTIFIED USING STRUCTURED AND FREE TEXT CLINICAL DATA, SUBJECTED THROUGH NLP FROM THE CLINICAL TEXT ANALYSIS KNOWLEDGE EXTRACTION SYSTEM. WE EXPLORED SEVERAL DIMENSION REDUCTION TECHNIQUES FOR THE NLP DATA, INCLUDING NEWER HIGH-THROUGHPUT PHENOTYPING AND WORD EMBEDDING METHODS, AND ASCERTAINED THEIR EFFECTIVENESS IN IDENTIFYING THE PHENOTYPE WITHOUT STRUCTURED PREDICTOR VARIABLES. WITH THE COMBINED STRUCTURED AND NLP VARIABLES, WE ANALYZED FIVE PHENOTYPING ALGORITHMS: PENALIZED LOGISTIC REGRESSION, NAIVE BAYES, SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES, RANDOM FOREST, AND GRADIENT BOOSTING. CALIBRATION AND DISCRIMINATION METRICS WERE CALCULATED USING 100 BOOTSTRAP ITERATIONS. IN THE FINAL MODEL, WE REPORT ODDS RATIOS AND 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVALS. RESULTS: THE AREA UNDER THE RECEIVER OPERATING CHARACTERISTIC CURVE (AUC) FOR THE DIFFERENT MODELS RANGED FROM 0.73 TO 0.93; WITH PENALIZED LOGISTIC REGRESSION HAVING THE BEST DISCRIMINATORY PERFORMANCE. CALIBRATION FOR LOGISTIC REGRESSION WAS MODEST, BUT GRADIENT BOOSTING AND SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES WERE SUPERIOR. NLP IDENTIFIED 6985 VARIABLES; A PRIORI VARIABLE SELECTION PERFORMED SIMILARLY TO DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION USING HIGH-THROUGHPUT PHENOTYPING AND SEMANTIC SIMILARITY INFORMED CLUSTERING (AUC OF 0.81 - 0.82). CONCLUSION: THIS STUDY DEMONSTRATED IMPROVED PHENOTYPING OF A CHALLENGING AKI ETIOLOGY, HRS, OVER ICD-9 CODING. WE ALSO COMPARED PERFORMANCE AMONG MULTIPLE APPROACHES TO EHR-DERIVED PHENOTYPING, AND FOUND SIMILAR RESULTS BETWEEN METHODS. LASTLY, WE SHOWED THAT AUTOMATED NLP DIMENSION REDUCTION IS VIABLE FOR ACUTE ILLNESS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
DEVELOPMENT OF INTEGRATED NEURAL NETWORK MODEL FOR IDENTIFICATION OF FAKE REVIEWS IN E-COMMERCE USING MULTIDOMAIN DATASETS. ONLINE PRODUCT REVIEWS PLAY A MAJOR ROLE IN THE SUCCESS OR FAILURE OF AN E-COMMERCE BUSINESS. BEFORE PROCURING PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, THE SHOPPERS USUALLY GO THROUGH THE ONLINE REVIEWS POSTED BY PREVIOUS CUSTOMERS TO GET RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE DETAILS OF PRODUCTS AND MAKE PURCHASING DECISIONS. NEVERTHELESS, IT IS POSSIBLE TO ENHANCE OR HAMPER SPECIFIC E-BUSINESS PRODUCTS BY POSTING FAKE REVIEWS, WHICH CAN BE WRITTEN BY PERSONS CALLED FRAUDSTERS. THESE REVIEWS CAN CAUSE FINANCIAL LOSS TO E-COMMERCE BUSINESSES AND MISGUIDE CONSUMERS TO TAKE THE WRONG DECISION TO SEARCH FOR ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS. THUS, DEVELOPING A FAKE REVIEW DETECTION SYSTEM IS ULTIMATELY REQUIRED FOR E-COMMERCE BUSINESS. THE PROPOSED METHODOLOGY HAS USED FOUR STANDARD FAKE REVIEW DATASETS OF MULTIDOMAINS INCLUDE HOTELS, RESTAURANTS, YELP, AND AMAZON. FURTHER, PREPROCESSING METHODS SUCH AS STOPWORD REMOVAL, PUNCTUATION REMOVAL, AND TOKENIZATION HAVE PERFORMED AS WELL AS PADDING SEQUENCE METHOD FOR MAKING THE INPUT SEQUENCE HAS FIXED LENGTH DURING TRAINING, VALIDATION, AND TESTING THE MODEL. AS THIS METHODOLOGY USES DIFFERENT SIZES OF DATASETS, VARIOUS INPUT WORD-EMBEDDING MATRICES OF N-GRAM FEATURES OF THE REVIEW'S TEXT ARE DEVELOPED AND CREATED WITH HELP OF WORD-EMBEDDING LAYER THAT IS ONE COMPONENT OF THE PROPOSED MODEL. CONVOLUTIONAL AND MAX-POOLING LAYERS OF THE CNN TECHNIQUE ARE IMPLEMENTED FOR DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION AND FEATURE EXTRACTION, RESPECTIVELY. BASED ON GATE MECHANISMS, THE LSTM LAYER IS COMBINED WITH THE CNN TECHNIQUE FOR LEARNING AND HANDLING THE CONTEXTUAL INFORMATION OF N-GRAM FEATURES OF THE REVIEW'S TEXT. FINALLY, A SIGMOID ACTIVATION FUNCTION AS THE LAST LAYER OF THE PROPOSED MODEL RECEIVES THE INPUT SEQUENCES FROM THE PREVIOUS LAYER AND PERFORMS BINARY CLASSIFICATION TASK OF REVIEW TEXT INTO FAKE OR TRUTHFUL. IN THIS PAPER, THE PROPOSED CNN-LSTM MODEL WAS EVALUATED IN TWO TYPES OF EXPERIMENTS, IN-DOMAIN AND CROSS-DOMAIN EXPERIMENTS. FOR AN IN-DOMAIN EXPERIMENT, THE MODEL IS APPLIED ON EACH DATASET INDIVIDUALLY, WHILE IN THE CASE OF A CROSS-DOMAIN EXPERIMENT, ALL DATASETS ARE GATHERED AND PUT INTO A SINGLE DATA FRAME AND EVALUATED ENTIRELY. THE TESTING RESULTS OF THE MODEL IN-DOMAIN EXPERIMENT DATASETS WERE 77%, 85%, 86%, AND 87% IN THE TERMS OF ACCURACY FOR RESTAURANT, HOTEL, YELP, AND AMAZON DATASETS, RESPECTIVELY. CONCERNING THE CROSS-DOMAIN EXPERIMENT, THE PROPOSED MODEL HAS ATTAINED 89% ACCURACY. FURTHERMORE, COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE RESULTS OF IN-DOMAIN EXPERIMENTS WITH EXISTING APPROACHES HAS BEEN DONE BASED ON ACCURACY METRIC AND, IT IS OBSERVED THAT THE PROPOSED MODEL OUTPERFORMED THE COMPARED METHODS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
DICE: A DRUG INDICATION CLASSIFICATION AND ENCYCLOPEDIA FOR AI-BASED INDICATION EXTRACTION. DRUG LABELING CONTAINS AN 'INDICATIONS AND USAGE' THAT PROVIDES VITAL INFORMATION TO SUPPORT CLINICAL DECISION MAKING AND REGULATORY MANAGEMENT. EFFECTIVE EXTRACTION OF DRUG INDICATION INFORMATION FROM FREE-TEXT BASED RESOURCES COULD FACILITATE DRUG REPOSITIONING PROJECTS AND HELP COLLECT REAL-WORLD EVIDENCE IN SUPPORT OF SECONDARY USE OF APPROVED MEDICINES. TO ENABLE AI-POWERED LANGUAGE MODELS FOR THE EXTRACTION OF DRUG INDICATION INFORMATION, WE USED MANUAL READING AND CURATION TO DEVELOP A DRUG INDICATION CLASSIFICATION AND ENCYCLOPEDIA (DICE) BASED ON FDA APPROVED HUMAN PRESCRIPTION DRUG LABELING. A DICE SCHEME WITH 7,231 SENTENCES CATEGORIZED INTO FIVE CLASSES (INDICATIONS, CONTRADICTIONS, SIDE EFFECTS, USAGE INSTRUCTIONS, AND CLINICAL OBSERVATIONS) WAS DEVELOPED. TO FURTHER ELUCIDATE THE UTILITY OF THE DICE, WE DEVELOPED NINE DIFFERENT AI-BASED CLASSIFIERS FOR THE PREDICTION OF INDICATIONS BASED ON THE DEVELOPED DICE TO COMPREHENSIVELY ASSESS THEIR PERFORMANCE. WE FOUND THAT THE TRANSFORMER-BASED LANGUAGE MODELS YIELDED AN AVERAGE MCC OF 0.887, OUTPERFORMING THE WORD EMBEDDING-BASED BIDIRECTIONAL LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY (BILSTM) MODELS (0.862) WITH A 2.82% IMPROVEMENT ON THE TEST SET. THE BEST CLASSIFIERS WERE ALSO USED TO EXTRACT DRUG INDICATION INFORMATION IN DRUGBANK AND ACHIEVED A HIGH ENRICHMENT RATE (>0.930) FOR THIS TASK. WE FOUND THAT DOMAIN-SPECIFIC TRAINING COULD PROVIDE MORE EXPLAINABLE MODELS WITHOUT PERFORMANCE SACRIFICES AND BETTER GENERALIZATION FOR EXTERNAL VALIDATION DATASETS. ALTOGETHER, THE PROPOSED DICE COULD BE A STANDARD RESOURCE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION OF TASK-SPECIFIC AI-POWERED, NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) MODELS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
DIETARY PATTERN EXTRACTION USING NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING TECHNIQUES. IN THIS STUDY, WE OBSERVED THE CHANGES IN DIETARY PATTERNS AMONG KOREAN ADULTS IN THE PREVIOUS DECADE. WE EVALUATED DIETARY INTAKE USING 24-H RECALL DATA FROM THE FOURTH (2007-2009) AND SEVENTH (2016-2018) KOREA NATIONAL HEALTH AND NUTRITION EXAMINATION SURVEY. MACHINE LEARNING-BASED METHODOLOGIES WERE USED TO EXTRACT THESE DIETARY PATTERNS. PARTICULARLY, WE OBSERVED THREE DIETARY PATTERNS FROM EACH SURVEY SIMILAR TO THE TRADITIONAL AND WESTERN DIETARY PATTERNS IN 2007-2009 AND 2016-2018, RESPECTIVELY. OUR RESULTS REVEAL A CONSIDERABLE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF WESTERN DIETARY PATTERNS COMPARED WITH THE PREVIOUS DECADE. THUS, OUR STUDY CONTRIBUTES TO THE USE OF NOVEL METHODS USING NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) TECHNIQUES FOR DIETARY PATTERN EXTRACTION TO OBTAIN MORE USEFUL DIETARY INFORMATION, UNLIKE THE TRADITIONAL METHODOLOGY.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
DISCOVERING NEW SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH CONCEPTS FROM UNSTRUCTURED DATA: FRAMEWORK AND EVALUATION. SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH (SDOH) ARE THE COMPLEX SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH INDIVIDUALS ARE BORN, OR WITH WHICH THEY LIVE, THAT IMPACT THEIR HEALTH. INTEGRATING SDOH INTO PRACTICE REQUIRES THAT INFORMATION SYSTEMS ARE ABLE TO IDENTIFY SDOH-RELATED CONCEPTS FROM CHARTS AND CASE NOTES THROUGH VOCABULARIES OR TERMINOLOGIES. DESPITE SIGNIFICANT STANDARDISATION EFFORTS ACROSS HEALTHCARE DOMAINS, SDOH COVERAGE REMAINS SPARSE IN EXISTING TERMINOLOGIES DUE TO THE BROAD SPECTRUM OF THIS DOMAIN, RANGING FROM FAMILY RELATIONS, RISK FACTORS, TO SOCIAL PROGRAMS AND BENEFITS, WHICH ARE NOT CONSISTENTLY CAPTURED ACROSS ADMINISTRATIVE AND CLINICAL SETTINGS. THIS PAPER PRESENTS A FRAMEWORK TO MINE, EVALUATE AND RECOMMEND NEW MULTIDISCIPLINARY CONCEPTS THAT RELATE TO OR IMPACT THE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF INDIVIDUALS USING A WORD EMBEDDING MODEL TRAINED FROM A LARGE DYNAMIC CORPUS OF UNSTRUCTURED DATA. FIVE KEY SDOH DOMAINS WERE SELECTED AND EVALUATED BY DOMAIN EXPERTS. THE CONCEPTS RESULTING FROM THE TRAINED MODEL WERE MATCHED AGAINST WELL-ESTABLISHED META-THESAURUS UMLS AND TERMINOLOGY SNOMED-CT AND, OVERALL, A SIGNIFICANT PROPORTION OF CONCEPTS FROM A SET OF 10,000 CANDIDATES WERE NOT FOUND (31% AND 28% RESPECTIVELY). THE RESULTS CONFIRM BOTH THE GAPS IN CURRENT TERMINOLOGIES AND THE FEASIBILITY AND IMPACT OF THE METHODS PRESENTED IN THIS PAPER FOR THE INCREMENTAL DISCOVERY AND VALIDATION OF NEW SDOH CONCEPTS TOGETHER WITH DOMAIN EXPERTS. THIS SUSTAINABLE APPROACH FACILITATES THE DEVELOPMENT AND REFINEMENT OF NEW AND EXISTING TERMINOLOGIES AND, IN TURN, IT ALLOWS SYSTEMS SUCH AS NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) ANNOTATORS TO LEVERAGE SDOH CONCEPTS ACROSS INTEGRATED CARE SETTINGS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
DISEASE NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION USING LONG-SHORT DEPENDENCIES. THE AUTOMATIC EXTRACTION OF DISEASE NAMED ENTITY IS A CHALLENGING RESEARCH PROBLEM THAT HAS ATTRACTED ATTENTION FROM THE BIOMEDICAL TEXT MINING COMMUNITY. HANDCRAFTED FEATURE METHODS WERE EMPLOYED FOR THIS TASK GIVEN A LITTLE SUCCESS SINCE THEY ARE LIMITED BY THE SCOPE OF THE EXPERT. LATELY, DEEP LEARNING-BASED METHODS HAVE BEEN EMPLOYED TO SOLVE THIS ISSUE. HOWEVER, MOST ARCHITECTURES USED FOR THIS TASK TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION LONG DEPENDENCIES ONLY. THE PROPOSED METHOD IS A TWO-STAGE DEEP NEURAL NETWORK MODEL. WE START BY DISCOVERING LOCAL DEPENDENCIES AND CREATING HIGH-LEVEL FEATURES FROM WORD EMBEDDING INPUTS USING A DEEP CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK. THEN WE IDENTIFY LONG DEPENDENCIES USING A BI-DIRECTIONAL RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORK. TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF UNBALANCED DATASET GIVEN BY THE BMEWO TAGGING SCHEMA AND TO ENFORCE SEQUENCE MODELING, WE DEVELOPED A NEW POS-BASED TAGGING SCHEMA THAT SUBDIVIDES THE DOMINANT CLASS INTO SMALLER MORE BALANCED UNITS. THE PROPOSED SYSTEM WAS TRAINED AND TESTED ON NCBI AND ACHIEVED AN [FORMULA: SEE TEXT]-SCORE OF 85.59 OUTPERFORMING THE CURRENT STATE-OF-THE-ART METHODS. OUR RESEARCH RESULTS SHOW THE EFFECTIVENESS OF USING BOTH LONG AND SHORT DEPENDENCIES. THE RESULTS ALSO ILLUSTRATE THE BENEFITS OF COMBINING DIFFERENT WORD EMBEDDING TECHNIQUES AND THE INCORPORATION OF MORPHOLOGICAL FEATURES IN THIS TASK.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
DISTRIBUTED REPRESENTATION OF CHEMICAL FRAGMENTS. THIS ARTICLE DESCRIBES AN UNSUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING METHOD FOR COMPUTING DISTRIBUTED VECTOR REPRESENTATION OF MOLECULAR FRAGMENTS. THESE VECTORS ENCODE FRAGMENT FEATURES IN A CONTINUOUS HIGH-DIMENSIONAL SPACE AND ENABLE SIMILARITY COMPUTATION BETWEEN INDIVIDUAL FRAGMENTS, EVEN FOR SMALL FRAGMENTS WITH ONLY TWO HEAVY ATOMS. THE METHOD IS BASED ON A WORD EMBEDDING ALGORITHM BORROWED FROM NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING FIELD, AND APPROXIMATELY 6 MILLION UNLABELED PUBCHEM CHEMICALS WERE USED FOR TRAINING. THE RESULTING DENSE FRAGMENT VECTORS ARE IN CONTRAST TO THE TRADITIONAL SPARSE "ONE-HOT" FRAGMENT REPRESENTATION AND CAPTURE RICH RELATIONAL STRUCTURE IN THE FRAGMENT SPACE. THE VECTORS OF SMALL LINEAR FRAGMENTS WERE AVERAGED TO YIELD DISTRIBUTED VECTORS OF BIGGER FRAGMENTS AND MOLECULES, WHICH WERE USED FOR DIFFERENT TASKS, E.G., CLUSTERING, LIGAND RECALL, AND QUANTITATIVE STRUCTURE-ACTIVITY RELATIONSHIP MODELING. THE DISTRIBUTED VECTORS WERE FOUND TO BE BETTER AT CLUSTERING RING SYSTEMS AND RECALL OF KINASE LIGANDS AS COMPARED TO STANDARD BINARY FINGERPRINTS. THIS WORK DEMONSTRATES UNSUPERVISED LEARNING OF FRAGMENT CHEMISTRY FROM LARGE SETS OF UNLABELED CHEMICAL STRUCTURES AND SUBSEQUENT APPLICATION TO SUPERVISED TRAINING ON RELATIVELY SMALL DATA SETS OF LABELED CHEMICALS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
DIVE INTO MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS FOR INFLUENZA VIRUS HOST PREDICTION WITH HEMAGGLUTININ SEQUENCES. INFLUENZA VIRUSES MUTATE RAPIDLY AND CAN POSE A THREAT TO PUBLIC HEALTH, ESPECIALLY TO THOSE IN VULNERABLE GROUPS. THROUGHOUT HISTORY, INFLUENZA A VIRUSES HAVE CAUSED PANDEMICS BETWEEN DIFFERENT SPECIES. IT IS IMPORTANT TO IDENTIFY THE ORIGIN OF A VIRUS IN ORDER TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF AN OUTBREAK. RECENTLY, THERE HAS BEEN INCREASING INTEREST IN USING MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS TO PROVIDE FAST AND ACCURATE PREDICTIONS FOR VIRAL SEQUENCES. IN THIS STUDY, REAL TESTING DATA SETS AND A VARIETY OF EVALUATION METRICS WERE USED TO EVALUATE MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS AT DIFFERENT TAXONOMIC LEVELS. AS HEMAGGLUTININ IS THE MAJOR PROTEIN IN THE IMMUNE RESPONSE, ONLY HEMAGGLUTININ SEQUENCES WERE USED AND REPRESENTED BY POSITION-SPECIFIC SCORING MATRIX AND WORD EMBEDDING. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE 5-GRAMS-TRANSFORMER NEURAL NETWORK IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE ALGORITHM FOR PREDICTING VIRAL SEQUENCE ORIGINS, WITH APPROXIMATELY 99.54% AUCPR, 98.01% F1 SCORE AND 96.60% MCC AT A HIGHER CLASSIFICATION LEVEL, AND APPROXIMATELY 94.74% AUCPR, 87.41% F1 SCORE AND 80.79% MCC AT A LOWER CLASSIFICATION LEVEL.

AT LAST, WE DEVELOPED THE ONLINE WEBSERVER HTTP://NSCLBIO.JBNU.AC.KR/TOOLS/4MCNLP-DEEP/ , FOR THE EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCHERS TO GET THE RESULTS EASILY.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
DOCUMENT-LEVEL BIOMEDICAL RELATION EXTRACTION USING GRAPH CONVOLUTIONAL NETWORK AND MULTIHEAD ATTENTION: ALGORITHM DEVELOPMENT AND VALIDATION. BACKGROUND: AUTOMATICALLY EXTRACTING RELATIONS BETWEEN CHEMICALS AND DISEASES PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN BIOMEDICAL TEXT MINING. CHEMICAL-DISEASE RELATION (CDR) EXTRACTION AIMS AT EXTRACTING COMPLEX SEMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN ENTITIES IN DOCUMENTS, WHICH CONTAIN INTRASENTENCE AND INTERSENTENCE RELATIONS. MOST PREVIOUS METHODS DID NOT CONSIDER DEPENDENCY SYNTACTIC INFORMATION ACROSS THE SENTENCES, WHICH ARE VERY VALUABLE FOR THE RELATIONS EXTRACTION TASK, IN PARTICULAR, FOR EXTRACTING THE INTERSENTENCE RELATIONS ACCURATELY. OBJECTIVE: IN THIS PAPER, WE PROPOSE A NOVEL END-TO-END NEURAL NETWORK BASED ON THE GRAPH CONVOLUTIONAL NETWORK (GCN) AND MULTIHEAD ATTENTION, WHICH MAKES USE OF THE DEPENDENCY SYNTACTIC INFORMATION ACROSS THE SENTENCES TO IMPROVE CDR EXTRACTION TASK. METHODS: TO IMPROVE THE PERFORMANCE OF INTERSENTENCE RELATION EXTRACTION, WE CONSTRUCTED A DOCUMENT-LEVEL DEPENDENCY GRAPH TO CAPTURE THE DEPENDENCY SYNTACTIC INFORMATION ACROSS SENTENCES. GCN IS APPLIED TO CAPTURE THE FEATURE REPRESENTATION OF THE DOCUMENT-LEVEL DEPENDENCY GRAPH. THE MULTIHEAD ATTENTION MECHANISM IS EMPLOYED TO LEARN THE RELATIVELY IMPORTANT CONTEXT FEATURES FROM DIFFERENT SEMANTIC SUBSPACES. TO ENHANCE THE INPUT REPRESENTATION, THE DEEP CONTEXT REPRESENTATION IS USED IN OUR MODEL INSTEAD OF TRADITIONAL WORD EMBEDDING. RESULTS: WE EVALUATE OUR METHOD ON CDR CORPUS. THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS SHOW THAT OUR METHOD ACHIEVES AN F-MEASURE OF 63.5%, WHICH IS SUPERIOR TO OTHER STATE-OF-THE-ART METHODS. IN THE INTRASENTENCE LEVEL, OUR METHOD ACHIEVES A PRECISION, RECALL, AND F-MEASURE OF 59.1%, 81.5%, AND 68.5%, RESPECTIVELY. IN THE INTERSENTENCE LEVEL, OUR METHOD ACHIEVES A PRECISION, RECALL, AND F-MEASURE OF 47.8%, 52.2%, AND 49.9%, RESPECTIVELY. CONCLUSIONS: THE GCN MODEL CAN EFFECTIVELY EXPLOIT THE ACROSS SENTENCE DEPENDENCY INFORMATION TO IMPROVE THE PERFORMANCE OF INTERSENTENCE CDR EXTRACTION. BOTH THE DEEP CONTEXT REPRESENTATION AND MULTIHEAD ATTENTION ARE HELPFUL IN THE CDR EXTRACTION TASK.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
DRUG DRUG INTERACTION EXTRACTION FROM BIOMEDICAL LITERATURE USING SYNTAX CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK. MOTIVATION: DETECTING DRUG-DRUG INTERACTION (DDI) HAS BECOME A VITAL PART OF PUBLIC HEALTH SAFETY. THEREFORE, USING TEXT MINING TECHNIQUES TO EXTRACT DDIS FROM BIOMEDICAL LITERATURE HAS RECEIVED GREAT ATTENTIONS. HOWEVER, THIS RESEARCH IS STILL AT AN EARLY STAGE AND ITS PERFORMANCE HAS MUCH ROOM TO IMPROVE. RESULTS: IN THIS ARTICLE, WE PRESENT A SYNTAX CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (SCNN) BASED DDI EXTRACTION METHOD. IN THIS METHOD, A NOVEL WORD EMBEDDING, SYNTAX WORD EMBEDDING, IS PROPOSED TO EMPLOY THE SYNTACTIC INFORMATION OF A SENTENCE. THEN THE POSITION AND PART OF SPEECH FEATURES ARE INTRODUCED TO EXTEND THE EMBEDDING OF EACH WORD. LATER, AUTO-ENCODER IS INTRODUCED TO ENCODE THE TRADITIONAL BAG-OF-WORDS FEATURE (SPARSE 0-1 VECTOR) AS THE DENSE REAL VALUE VECTOR. FINALLY, A COMBINATION OF EMBEDDING-BASED CONVOLUTIONAL FEATURES AND TRADITIONAL FEATURES ARE FED TO THE SOFTMAX CLASSIFIER TO EXTRACT DDIS FROM BIOMEDICAL LITERATURE. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS ON THE DDIEXTRACTION 2013 CORPUS SHOW THAT SCNN OBTAINS A BETTER PERFORMANCE (AN F-SCORE OF 0.686) THAN OTHER STATE-OF-THE-ART METHODS.

DRUG REPURPOSING PREDICTION FOR IMMUNE-MEDIATED CUTANEOUS DISEASES USING A WORD-EMBEDDING-BASED MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH. IMMUNE-MEDIATED DISEASES AFFECT MORE THAN 20% OF THE POPULATION, AND MANY AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES AFFECT THE SKIN. DRUG REPURPOSING (OR REPOSITIONING) IS A COST-EFFECTIVE APPROACH FOR FINDING DRUGS THAT CAN BE USED TO TREAT DISEASES FOR WHICH THEY ARE CURRENTLY NOT PRESCRIBED. WE IMPLEMENTED AN EFFICIENT BIOINFORMATICS APPROACH USING WORD EMBEDDING TO SUMMARIZE DRUG INFORMATION FROM MORE THAN 20 MILLION ARTICLES AND APPLIED MACHINE LEARNING TO MODEL THE DRUG-DISEASE RELATIONSHIP. WE TRAINED OUR DRUG REPURPOSING APPROACH SEPARATELY ON NINE CUTANEOUS DISEASES (INCLUDING PSORIASIS, ATOPIC DERMATITIS, AND ALOPECIA AREATA) AND EIGHT OTHER IMMUNE-MEDIATED DISEASES AND OBTAINED A MEAN AREA UNDER THE RECEIVER OPERATING CHARACTERISTIC OF 0.93 IN CROSS-VALIDATION. FOCUSING IN PARTICULAR ON PSORIASIS, A CHRONIC INFLAMMATORY CONDITION OF SKIN THAT AFFECTS MORE THAN 100 MILLION PEOPLE WORLDWIDE, WE WERE ABLE TO CONFIRM DRUGS THAT ARE KNOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE FOR PSORIASIS AND TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL CANDIDATES USED TO TREAT OTHER DISEASES. FURTHERMORE, THE TARGETS OF DRUG CANDIDATES PREDICTED BY OUR APPROACH WERE SIGNIFICANTLY ENRICHED AMONG GENES DIFFERENTIALLY EXPRESSED IN PSORIATIC LESIONAL SKIN FROM A LARGE-SCALE RNA SEQUENCING COHORT. ALTHOUGH OUR ALGORITHM CANNOT BE USED TO DETERMINE CLINICAL EFFICACY, OUR WORK PROVIDES AN APPROACH FOR SUGGESTING DRUGS FOR REPURPOSING TO IMMUNE-MEDIATED CUTANEOUS DISEASES.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
DRUG-DRUG INTERACTION EXTRACTION VIA RECURRENT HYBRID CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS WITH AN IMPROVED FOCAL LOSS. DRUG-DRUG INTERACTIONS (DDIS) MAY BRING HUGE HEALTH RISKS AND DANGEROUS EFFECTS TO A PATIENT'S BODY WHEN TAKING TWO OR MORE DRUGS AT THE SAME TIME OR WITHIN A CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME. THEREFORE, THE AUTOMATIC EXTRACTION OF UNKNOWN DDIS HAS GREAT POTENTIAL FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF PHARMACEUTICAL AGENTS AND THE SAFETY OF DRUG USE. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE PROPOSE A NOVEL RECURRENT HYBRID CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (RHCNN) FOR DDI EXTRACTION FROM BIOMEDICAL LITERATURE. IN THE EMBEDDING LAYER, THE TEXTS MENTIONING TWO ENTITIES ARE REPRESENTED AS A SEQUENCE OF SEMANTIC EMBEDDINGS AND POSITION EMBEDDINGS. IN PARTICULAR, THE COMPLETE SEMANTIC EMBEDDING IS OBTAINED BY THE INFORMATION FUSION BETWEEN A WORD EMBEDDING AND ITS CONTEXTUAL INFORMATION WHICH IS LEARNT BY RECURRENT STRUCTURE. AFTER THAT, THE HYBRID CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK IS EMPLOYED TO LEARN THE SENTENCE-LEVEL FEATURES WHICH CONSIST OF THE LOCAL CONTEXT FEATURES FROM CONSECUTIVE WORDS AND THE DEPENDENCY FEATURES BETWEEN SEPARATED WORDS FOR DDI EXTRACTION. LASTLY BUT MOST SIGNIFICANTLY, IN ORDER TO MAKE UP FOR THE DEFECTS OF THE TRADITIONAL CROSS-ENTROPY LOSS FUNCTION WHEN DEALING WITH CLASS IMBALANCED DATA, WE APPLY AN IMPROVED FOCAL LOSS FUNCTION TO MITIGATE AGAINST THIS PROBLEM WHEN USING THE DDIEXTRACTION 2013 DATASET. IN OUR EXPERIMENTS, WE ACHIEVE DDI AUTOMATIC EXTRACTION WITH A MICRO F-SCORE OF 75.48% ON THE DDIEXTRACTION 2013 DATASET, OUTPERFORMING THE STATE-OF-THE-ART APPROACH BY 2.49%.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
DUAL CNN FOR RELATION EXTRACTION WITH KNOWLEDGE-BASED ATTENTION AND WORD EMBEDDINGS. RELATION EXTRACTION IS THE UNDERLYING CRITICAL TASK OF TEXTUAL UNDERSTANDING. HOWEVER, THE EXISTING METHODS CURRENTLY HAVE DEFECTS IN INSTANCE SELECTION AND LACK BACKGROUND KNOWLEDGE FOR ENTITY RECOGNITION. IN THIS PAPER, WE PROPOSE A KNOWLEDGE-BASED ATTENTION MODEL, WHICH CAN MAKE FULL USE OF SUPERVISED INFORMATION FROM A KNOWLEDGE BASE, TO SELECT AN ENTITY. WE ALSO DESIGN A METHOD OF DUAL CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS (CNNS) CONSIDERING THE WORD EMBEDDING OF EACH WORD IS RESTRICTED BY USING A SINGLE TRAINING TOOL. THE PROPOSED MODEL COMBINES A CNN WITH AN ATTENTION MECHANISM. THE MODEL INSERTS THE WORD EMBEDDING AND SUPERVISED INFORMATION FROM THE KNOWLEDGE BASE INTO THE CNN, PERFORMS CONVOLUTION AND POOLING, AND COMBINES THE KNOWLEDGE BASE AND CNN IN THE FULL CONNECTION LAYER. BASED ON THESE PROCESSES, THE MODEL NOT ONLY OBTAINS BETTER ENTITY REPRESENTATIONS BUT ALSO IMPROVES THE PERFORMANCE OF RELATION EXTRACTION WITH THE HELP OF RICH BACKGROUND KNOWLEDGE. THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT THE PROPOSED MODEL ACHIEVES COMPETITIVE PERFORMANCE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
DYNAMIC EMBEDDING PROJECTION-GATED CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS FOR TEXT CLASSIFICATION. TEXT CLASSIFICATION IS A FUNDAMENTAL AND IMPORTANT AREA OF NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING FOR ASSIGNING A TEXT INTO AT LEAST ONE PREDEFINED TAG OR CATEGORY ACCORDING TO ITS CONTENT. MOST OF THE ADVANCED SYSTEMS ARE EITHER TOO SIMPLE TO GET HIGH ACCURACY OR CENTERED ON USING COMPLEX STRUCTURES TO CAPTURE THE GENUINELY REQUIRED CATEGORY INFORMATION, WHICH REQUIRES LONG TIME TO CONVERGE DURING THEIR TRAINING STAGE. IN ORDER TO ADDRESS SUCH CHALLENGING ISSUES, WE PROPOSE A DYNAMIC EMBEDDING PROJECTION-GATED CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (DEP-CNN) FOR MULTI-CLASS AND MULTI-LABEL TEXT CLASSIFICATION. ITS DYNAMIC EMBEDDING PROJECTION GATE (DEPG) TRANSFORMS AND CARRIES WORD INFORMATION BY USING GATING UNITS AND SHORTCUT CONNECTIONS TO CONTROL HOW MUCH CONTEXT INFORMATION IS INCORPORATED INTO EACH SPECIFIC POSITION OF A WORD-EMBEDDING MATRIX IN A TEXT. TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, WE ARE THE FIRST TO APPLY DEPG OVER A WORD-EMBEDDING MATRIX. THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS ON FOUR KNOWN BENCHMARK DATASETS DISPLAY THAT DEP-CNN OUTPERFORMS ITS RECENT PEERS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
EAGS: AN EXTRACTING AUXILIARY KNOWLEDGE GRAPH MODEL IN MULTI-TURN DIALOGUE GENERATION. MULTI-TURN DIALOGUE GENERATION IS AN ESSENTIAL AND CHALLENGING SUBTASK OF TEXT GENERATION IN THE QUESTION ANSWERING SYSTEM. EXISTING METHODS FOCUSED ON EXTRACTING LATENT TOPIC-LEVEL RELEVANCE OR UTILIZING RELEVANT EXTERNAL BACKGROUND KNOWLEDGE. HOWEVER, THEY ARE PRONE TO IGNORE THE FACT THAT RELYING TOO MUCH ON LATENT ASPECTS WILL LOSE SUBJECTIVE KEY INFORMATION. FURTHERMORE, THERE IS NOT SO MUCH RELEVANT EXTERNAL KNOWLEDGE THAT CAN BE USED FOR REFERENCING OR A GRAPH THAT HAS COMPLETE ENTITY LINKS. DEPENDENCY TREE IS A SPECIAL STRUCTURE THAT CAN BE EXTRACTED FROM SENTENCES, IT COVERS THE EXPLICIT KEY INFORMATION OF SENTENCES. THEREFORE, IN THIS PAPER, WE PROPOSED THE EAGS MODEL, WHICH COMBINES THE SUBJECTIVE PIVOTAL INFORMATION FROM THE EXPLICIT DEPENDENCY TREE WITH SENTENCE IMPLICIT SEMANTIC INFORMATION. THE EAGS MODEL IS A KNOWLEDGE GRAPH ENABLED MULTI-TURN DIALOGUE GENERATION MODEL, AND IT DOESN'T NEED EXTRA EXTERNAL KNOWLEDGE, IT CAN NOT ONLY EXTRACT AND BUILD A DEPENDENCY KNOWLEDGE GRAPH FROM EXISTING SENTENCES, BUT ALSO PROMPT THE NODE REPRESENTATION, WHICH IS SHARED WITH BI-GRU EACH TIME STEP WORD EMBEDDING IN NODE SEMANTIC LEVEL. WE STORE THE SPECIFIC DOMAIN SUBGRAPHS BUILT BY THE EAGS, WHICH CAN BE RETRIEVED AS EXTERNAL KNOWLEDGE GRAPH IN THE FUTURE MULTI-TURN DIALOGUE GENERATION TASK. WE DESIGN A MULTI-TASK TRAINING APPROACH TO ENHANCE SEMANTICS AND STRUCTURE LOCAL FEATURE EXTRACTION, AND BALANCE WITH THE GLOBAL FEATURES. FINALLY, WE CONDUCT EXPERIMENTS ON UBUNTU LARGE-SCALE ENGLISH MULTI-TURN DIALOGUE COMMUNITY DATASET AND ENGLISH DAILY DIALOGUE DATASET. EXPERIMENT RESULTS SHOW THAT OUR EAGS MODEL PERFORMS WELL ON BOTH AUTOMATIC EVALUATION AND HUMAN EVALUATION COMPARED WITH THE EXISTING BASELINE MODELS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
EDLM(6)APRED: ENSEMBLE DEEP LEARNING APPROACH FOR MRNA M(6)A SITE PREDICTION. BACKGROUND: AS A COMMON AND ABUNDANT RNA METHYLATION MODIFICATION, N6-METHYLADENOSINE (M(6)A) IS WIDELY SPREAD IN VARIOUS SPECIES' TRANSCRIPTOMES, AND IT IS CLOSELY RELATED TO THE OCCURRENCE AND DEVELOPMENT OF VARIOUS LIFE PROCESSES AND DISEASES. THUS, ACCURATE IDENTIFICATION OF M(6)A METHYLATION SITES HAS BECOME A HOT TOPIC. MOST BIOLOGICAL METHODS RELY ON HIGH-THROUGHPUT SEQUENCING TECHNOLOGY, WHICH PLACES GREAT DEMANDS ON THE SEQUENCING LIBRARY PREPARATION AND DATA ANALYSIS. THUS, VARIOUS MACHINE LEARNING METHODS HAVE BEEN PROPOSED TO EXTRACT VARIOUS TYPES OF FEATURES BASED ON SEQUENCES, THEN OCCUPIED CONVENTIONAL CLASSIFIERS, SUCH AS SVM, RF, ETC., FOR M(6)A METHYLATION SITE IDENTIFICATION. HOWEVER, THE IDENTIFICATION PERFORMANCE RELIES HEAVILY ON THE EXTRACTED FEATURES, WHICH STILL NEED TO BE IMPROVED. RESULTS: THIS PAPER MAINLY STUDIES FEATURE EXTRACTION AND CLASSIFICATION OF M(6)A METHYLATION SITES IN A NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING WAY, WHICH MANAGES TO ORGANICALLY INTEGRATE THE FEATURE EXTRACTION AND CLASSIFICATION SIMULTANEOUSLY, WITH CONSIDERATION OF UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM INFORMATION OF M(6)A SITES. ONE-HOT, RNA WORD EMBEDDING, AND WORD2VEC ARE ADOPTED TO DEPICT SITES FROM THE PERSPECTIVES OF THE BASE AS WELL AS ITS UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM SEQUENCE. THE BILSTM MODEL, A WELL-KNOWN SEQUENCE MODEL, WAS THEN CONSTRUCTED TO DISCRIMINATE THE SEQUENCES WITH POTENTIAL M(6)A SITES. SINCE THE ABOVE-MENTIONED THREE FEATURE EXTRACTION METHODS FOCUS ON DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES OF M(6)A SITES, AN ENSEMBLE DEEP LEARNING PREDICTOR (EDLM(6)APRED) WAS FINALLY CONSTRUCTED FOR M(6)A SITE PREDICTION. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS ON HUMAN AND MOUSE DATA SETS SHOW THAT EDLM(6)APRED OUTPERFORMS THE OTHER SINGLE ONES, INDICATING THAT BASE, UPSTREAM, AND DOWNSTREAM INFORMATION ARE ALL ESSENTIAL FOR M(6)A SITE DETECTION. COMPARED WITH THE EXISTING M(6)A METHYLATION SITE PREDICTION MODELS WITHOUT GENOMIC FEATURES, EDLM(6)APRED OBTAINS 86.6% OF THE AREA UNDER RECEIVER OPERATING CURVE ON THE HUMAN DATA SETS, INDICATING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SEQUENTIAL MODELING ON RNA. TO MAXIMIZE USER CONVENIENCE, A WEBSERVER WAS DEVELOPED AS AN IMPLEMENTATION OF EDLM(6)APRED AND MADE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE AT WWW.XJTLU.EDU.CN/BIOLOGICALSCIENCES/EDLM6APRED .

EFFECT OF STEMMING ON TEXT SIMILARITY FOR ARABIC LANGUAGE AT SENTENCE LEVEL. SEMANTIC TEXT SIMILARITY (STS) HAS SEVERAL AND IMPORTANT APPLICATIONS IN THE FIELD OF NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP). THE AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF STEMMING ON TEXT SIMILARITY FOR ARABIC LANGUAGE AT SENTENCE LEVEL. SEVERAL ARABIC LIGHT AND HEAVY STEMMERS AS WELL AS LEMMATIZATION ALGORITHMS ARE USED IN THIS STUDY, WITH A TOTAL OF 10 ALGORITHMS. STANDARD TRAINING AND TESTING DATA SETS ARE USED FROM SEMEVAL-2017 INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP FOR TASK 1, TRACK 1 ARABIC (AR-AR). DIFFERENT FEATURES ARE SELECTED TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF STEMMING ON TEXT SIMILARITY BASED ON DIFFERENT SIMILARITY MEASURES. TRADITIONAL MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS ARE USED SUCH AS SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES (SVM), STOCHASTIC GRADIENT DESCENT (SGD) AND NAIVE BAYESIAN (NB). COMPARED TO THE ORIGINAL TEXT, USING THE STEMMED AND LEMMATIZED DOCUMENTS IN EXPERIMENTS ACHIEVE ENHANCED PEARSON CORRELATION RESULTS. THE BEST RESULTS ATTAINED WHEN USING ARABIC LIGHT STEMMER (ARLSTEM) AND FARASA LIGHT STEMMERS, FARASA AND QALSADI LEMMATIZERS AND TASHAPHYNE HEAVY STEMMER. THE BEST ENHANCEMENT WAS ABOUT 7.34% IN PEARSON CORRELATION. IN GENERAL, STEMMING CONSIDERABLY IMPROVES THE PERFORMANCE OF SENTENCE TEXT SIMILARLY FOR ARABIC LANGUAGE. HOWEVER, SOME STEMMERS MAKE RESULTS WORSE THAN THOSE FOR ORIGINAL TEXT; THEY ARE KHOJA HEAVY STEMMER AND ALKHALIL LIGHT STEMMER.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
EFFECTIVE TRAINING DATA EXTRACTION METHOD TO IMPROVE INFLUENZA OUTBREAK PREDICTION FROM ONLINE NEWS ARTICLES: DEEP LEARNING MODEL STUDY. BACKGROUND: EACH YEAR, INFLUENZA AFFECTS 3 TO 5 MILLION PEOPLE AND CAUSES 290,000 TO 650,000 FATALITIES WORLDWIDE. TO REDUCE THE FATALITIES CAUSED BY INFLUENZA, SEVERAL COUNTRIES HAVE ESTABLISHED INFLUENZA SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS TO COLLECT EARLY WARNING DATA. HOWEVER, PROPER AND TIMELY WARNINGS ARE HINDERED BY A 1- TO 2-WEEK DELAY BETWEEN THE ACTUAL DISEASE OUTBREAKS AND THE PUBLICATION OF SURVEILLANCE DATA. TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE, NOVEL METHODS FOR INFLUENZA SURVEILLANCE AND PREDICTION USING REAL-TIME INTERNET DATA (SUCH AS SEARCH QUERIES, MICROBLOGGING, AND NEWS) HAVE BEEN PROPOSED. SOME OF THE CURRENTLY POPULAR APPROACHES EXTRACT ONLINE DATA AND USE MACHINE LEARNING TO PREDICT INFLUENZA OCCURRENCES IN A CLASSIFICATION MODE. HOWEVER, MANY OF THESE METHODS EXTRACT TRAINING DATA SUBJECTIVELY, AND IT IS DIFFICULT TO CAPTURE THE LATENT CHARACTERISTICS OF THE DATA CORRECTLY. THERE IS A CRITICAL NEED TO DEVISE NEW APPROACHES THAT FOCUS ON EXTRACTING TRAINING DATA BY REFLECTING THE LATENT CHARACTERISTICS OF THE DATA. OBJECTIVE: IN THIS PAPER, WE PROPOSE AN EFFECTIVE METHOD TO EXTRACT TRAINING DATA IN A MANNER THAT REFLECTS THE HIDDEN FEATURES AND IMPROVES THE PERFORMANCE BY FILTERING AND SELECTING ONLY THE KEYWORDS RELATED TO INFLUENZA BEFORE THE PREDICTION. METHODS: ALTHOUGH WORD EMBEDDING PROVIDES A DISTRIBUTED REPRESENTATION OF WORDS BY ENCODING THE HIDDEN RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN VARIOUS TOKENS, WE ENHANCED THE WORD EMBEDDINGS BY SELECTING KEYWORDS RELATED TO THE INFLUENZA OUTBREAK AND SORTING THE EXTRACTED KEYWORDS USING THE PEARSON CORRELATION COEFFICIENT IN ORDER TO SOLELY KEEP THE TOKENS WITH HIGH CORRELATION WITH THE ACTUAL INFLUENZA OUTBREAK. THE KEYWORD EXTRACTION PROCESS WAS FOLLOWED BY A PREDICTIVE MODEL BASED ON LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY THAT PREDICTS THE INFLUENZA OUTBREAK. TO ASSESS THE PERFORMANCE OF THE PROPOSED PREDICTIVE MODEL, WE USED AND COMPARED A VARIETY OF WORD EMBEDDING TECHNIQUES. RESULTS: WORD EMBEDDING WITHOUT OUR PROPOSED SORTING PROCESS SHOWED 0.8705 PREDICTION ACCURACY WHEN 50.2 KEYWORDS WERE SELECTED ON AVERAGE. CONVERSELY, WORD EMBEDDING USING OUR PROPOSED SORTING PROCESS SHOWED 0.8868 PREDICTION ACCURACY AND AN IMPROVEMENT IN PREDICTION ACCURACY OF 12.6%, ALTHOUGH SMALLER AMOUNTS OF TRAINING DATA WERE SELECTED, WITH ONLY 20.6 KEYWORDS ON AVERAGE. CONCLUSIONS: THE SORTING STAGE EMPOWERS THE EMBEDDING PROCESS, WHICH IMPROVES THE FEATURE EXTRACTION PROCESS BECAUSE IT ACTS AS A KNOWLEDGE BASE FOR THE PREDICTION COMPONENT. THE MODEL OUTPERFORMED OTHER CURRENT APPROACHES THAT USE FLAT EXTRACTION BEFORE PREDICTION.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
EFFECTIVE TRANSFER LEARNING WITH LABEL-BASED DISCRIMINATIVE FEATURE LEARNING. THE PERFORMANCE OF NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING WITH A TRANSFER LEARNING METHODOLOGY HAS IMPROVED BY APPLYING PRE-TRAINING LANGUAGE MODELS TO DOWNSTREAM TASKS WITH A LARGE NUMBER OF GENERAL DATA. HOWEVER, BECAUSE THE DATA USED IN PRE-TRAINING ARE IRRELEVANT TO THE DOWNSTREAM TASKS, A PROBLEM OCCURS IN THAT IT LEARNS GENERAL FEATURES RATHER THAN THOSE FEATURES SPECIFIC TO THE DOWNSTREAM TASKS. IN THIS PAPER, A NOVEL LEARNING METHOD IS PROPOSED FOR EMBEDDING PRE-TRAINED MODELS TO LEARN SPECIFIC FEATURES OF SUCH TASKS. THE PROPOSED METHOD LEARNS THE LABEL FEATURES OF DOWNSTREAM TASKS THROUGH CONTRAST LEARNING USING LABEL EMBEDDING AND SAMPLED DATA PAIRS. TO DEMONSTRATE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE PROPOSED METHOD, WE CONDUCTED EXPERIMENTS ON SENTENCE CLASSIFICATION DATASETS AND EVALUATED WHETHER THE FEATURES OF THE DOWNSTREAM TASKS HAVE BEEN LEARNED THROUGH A PCA AND A CLUSTERING OF THE EMBEDDINGS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
EFFECTS OF MOTION-RELEVANT KNOWLEDGE FROM UNLABELED VIDEO TO HUMAN-OBJECT INTERACTION DETECTION. THE EXISTING WORKS ON HUMAN-OBJECT INTERACTION (HOI) DETECTION USUALLY RELY ON EXPENSIVE LARGE-SCALE LABELED IMAGE DATASETS. HOWEVER, IN REAL SCENES, LABELED DATA MAY BE INSUFFICIENT, AND SOME RARE HOI CATEGORIES HAVE FEW SAMPLES. THIS POSES GREAT CHALLENGES FOR DEEP-LEARNING-BASED HOI DETECTION MODELS. EXISTING WORKS TACKLE IT BY INTRODUCING COMPOSITIONAL LEARNING OR WORD EMBEDDING BUT STILL NEED LARGE-SCALE LABELED DATA OR EXTREMELY RELY ON THE WELL-LEARNED KNOWLEDGE. IN CONTRAST, THE FREELY AVAILABLE UNLABELED VIDEOS CONTAIN RICH MOTION-RELEVANT INFORMATION THAT CAN HELP INFER RARE HOIS. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE CREATIVELY PROPOSE A MULTITASK LEARNING (MTL) PERSPECTIVE TO ASSIST IN HOI DETECTION WITH THE AID OF MOTION-RELEVANT KNOWLEDGE LEARNING ON UNLABELED VIDEOS. SPECIFICALLY, WE DESIGN THE APPEARANCE RECONSTRUCTION LOSS (ARL) AND SEQUENTIAL MOTION MINING MODULE IN A SELF-SUPERVISED MANNER TO LEARN MORE GENERALIZABLE MOTION REPRESENTATIONS FOR PROMOTING THE DETECTION OF RARE HOIS. MOREOVER, TO BETTER TRANSFER MOTION-RELATED KNOWLEDGE FROM UNLABELED VIDEOS TO HOI IMAGES, A DOMAIN DISCRIMINATOR IS INTRODUCED TO DECREASE THE DOMAIN GAP BETWEEN TWO DOMAINS. EXTENSIVE EXPERIMENTS ON THE HICO-DET DATASET WITH RARE CATEGORIES AND THE V-COCO DATASET WITH MINIMUM SUPERVISION DEMONSTRATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF MOTION-AWARE KNOWLEDGE IMPLIED IN UNLABELED VIDEOS FOR HOI DETECTION.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
EFFICIENT REUSE OF NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING MODELS FOR PHENOTYPE-MENTION IDENTIFICATION IN FREE-TEXT ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS: A PHENOTYPE EMBEDDING APPROACH. BACKGROUND: MUCH EFFORT HAS BEEN PUT INTO THE USE OF AUTOMATED APPROACHES, SUCH AS NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP), TO MINE OR EXTRACT DATA FROM FREE-TEXT MEDICAL RECORDS IN ORDER TO CONSTRUCT COMPREHENSIVE PATIENT PROFILES FOR DELIVERING BETTER HEALTH CARE. REUSING NLP MODELS IN NEW SETTINGS, HOWEVER, REMAINS CUMBERSOME, AS IT REQUIRES VALIDATION AND RETRAINING ON NEW DATA ITERATIVELY TO ACHIEVE CONVERGENT RESULTS. OBJECTIVE: THE AIM OF THIS WORK IS TO MINIMIZE THE EFFORT INVOLVED IN REUSING NLP MODELS ON FREE-TEXT MEDICAL RECORDS. METHODS: WE FORMALLY DEFINE AND ANALYZE THE MODEL ADAPTATION PROBLEM IN PHENOTYPE-MENTION IDENTIFICATION TASKS. WE IDENTIFY "DUPLICATE WASTE" AND "IMBALANCE WASTE," WHICH COLLECTIVELY IMPEDE EFFICIENT MODEL REUSE. WE PROPOSE A PHENOTYPE EMBEDDING-BASED APPROACH TO MINIMIZE THESE SOURCES OF WASTE WITHOUT THE NEED FOR LABELLED DATA FROM NEW SETTINGS. RESULTS: WE CONDUCT EXPERIMENTS ON DATA FROM A LARGE MENTAL HEALTH REGISTRY TO REUSE NLP MODELS IN FOUR PHENOTYPE-MENTION IDENTIFICATION TASKS. THE PROPOSED APPROACH CAN CHOOSE THE BEST MODEL FOR A NEW TASK, IDENTIFYING UP TO 76% WASTE (DUPLICATE WASTE), THAT IS, PHENOTYPE MENTIONS WITHOUT THE NEED FOR VALIDATION AND MODEL RETRAINING AND WITH VERY GOOD PERFORMANCE (93%-97% ACCURACY). IT CAN ALSO PROVIDE GUIDANCE FOR VALIDATING AND RETRAINING THE SELECTED MODEL FOR NOVEL LANGUAGE PATTERNS IN NEW TASKS, SAVING AROUND 80% WASTE (IMBALANCE WASTE), THAT IS, THE EFFORT REQUIRED IN "BLIND" MODEL-ADAPTATION APPROACHES. CONCLUSIONS: ADAPTING PRETRAINED NLP MODELS FOR NEW TASKS CAN BE MORE EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE IF THE LANGUAGE PATTERN LANDSCAPES OF OLD SETTINGS AND NEW SETTINGS CAN BE MADE EXPLICIT AND COMPARABLE. OUR EXPERIMENTS SHOW THAT THE PHENOTYPE-MENTION EMBEDDING APPROACH IS AN EFFECTIVE WAY TO MODEL LANGUAGE PATTERNS FOR PHENOTYPE-MENTION IDENTIFICATION TASKS AND THAT ITS USE CAN GUIDE EFFICIENT NLP MODEL REUSE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS AS INPUT TO PREDICT POSTOPERATIVE IMMEDIATE REMISSION OF CUSHING'S DISEASE: APPLICATION OF WORD EMBEDDING. BACKGROUND: NO EXISTING MACHINE LEARNING (ML)-BASED MODELS USE FREE TEXT FROM ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS (EMR) AS INPUT TO PREDICT IMMEDIATE REMISSION (IR) OF CUSHING'S DISEASE (CD) AFTER TRANSSPHENOIDAL SURGERY. PURPOSE: THE AIM OF THE PRESENT STUDY IS TO DEVELOP AN ML-BASED MODEL THAT USES EMR THAT INCLUDE BOTH STRUCTURED FEATURES AND FREE TEXT AS INPUT TO PREOPERATIVELY PREDICT IR AFTER TRANSSPHENOIDAL SURGERY. METHODS: A TOTAL OF 419 PATIENTS WITH CD FROM PEKING UNION MEDICAL COLLEGE HOSPITAL WERE ENROLLED BETWEEN JANUARY 2014 AND AUGUST 2020. THE EMR OF THE PATIENTS WERE EMBEDDED AND TRANSFORMED INTO LOW-DIMENSIONAL DENSE VECTORS THAT CAN BE INCLUDED IN FOUR ML-BASED MODELS TOGETHER WITH STRUCTURED FEATURES. THE AREA UNDER THE CURVE (AUC) OF RECEIVER OPERATING CHARACTERISTIC CURVES WAS USED TO EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE MODELS. RESULTS: THE OVERALL REMISSION RATE OF THE 419 PATIENTS WAS 75.7%. FROM THE RESULTS OF LOGISTIC MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS, OPERATION (P < 0.001), INVASION OF CAVERNOUS SINUS FROM MRI (P = 0.046), AND ACTH (P = 0.024) WERE STRONGLY CORRELATED WITH IR. THE AUC VALUES FOR THE FOUR ML-BASED MODELS RANGED FROM 0.686 TO 0.793. THE HIGHEST AUC VALUE (0.793) WAS FOR LOGISTIC REGRESSION WHEN 11 STRUCTURED FEATURES AND "INDIVIDUAL CONCLUSIONS OF THE CASE BY DOCTOR" WERE INCLUDED. CONCLUSION: AN ML-BASED MODEL WAS DEVELOPED USING BOTH STRUCTURED AND UNSTRUCTURED FEATURES (AFTER BEING PROCESSED USING A WORD EMBEDDING METHOD) AS INPUT TO PREOPERATIVELY PREDICT POSTOPERATIVE IR.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
EMBEDDING ASSISTED PREDICTION ARCHITECTURE FOR EVENT TRIGGER IDENTIFICATION. MOLECULAR EVENTS NORMALLY HAVE SIGNIFICANT MEANINGS SINCE THEY DESCRIBE IMPORTANT BIOLOGICAL INTERACTIONS OR ALTERNATIONS SUCH AS BINDING OF A PROTEIN. AS A CRUCIAL STEP OF BIOLOGICAL EVENT EXTRACTION, EVENT TRIGGER IDENTIFICATION HAS ATTRACTED MUCH ATTENTION AND MANY METHODS HAVE BEEN PROPOSED. TRADITIONALLY THOSE METHODS CAN BE CATEGORISED INTO RULE-BASED APPROACH AND MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH AND MACHINE LEARNING-BASED APPROACHES HAVE DEMONSTRATED ITS POTENTIAL AND OUTPERFORMED RULE-BASED APPROACHES IN MANY SITUATIONS. HOWEVER, MACHINE LEARNING-BASED APPROACHES STILL FACE SEVERAL CHALLENGES AMONG WHICH A NOTABLE ONE IS HOW TO MODEL SEMANTIC AND SYNTACTIC INFORMATION OF DIFFERENT WORDS AND INCORPORATE IT INTO THE PREDICTION MODEL. THERE EXIST MANY WAYS TO MODEL SEMANTIC AND SYNTACTIC INFORMATION, AMONG WHICH WORD EMBEDDING IS AN EFFECTIVE ONE. THEREFORE, IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THIS CHALLENGE, IN THIS STUDY, A WORD EMBEDDING ASSISTED NEURAL NETWORK PREDICTION MODEL IS PROPOSED TO CONDUCT EVENT TRIGGER IDENTIFICATION. THE EXPERIMENTAL STUDY ON COMMONLY USED DATASET HAS SHOWN ITS POTENTIAL. IT IS BELIEVED THAT THIS STUDY COULD OFFER RESEARCHERS INSIGHTS INTO SEMANTIC-AWARE SOLUTIONS FOR EVENT TRIGGER IDENTIFICATION.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
EMBEDDING KNOWLEDGE ON ONTOLOGY INTO THE CORPUS BY TOPIC TO IMPROVE THE PERFORMANCE OF DEEP LEARNING METHODS IN SENTIMENT ANALYSIS. SENTIMENT CLASSIFICATION, WHICH USES DEEP LEARNING ALGORITHMS, HAS ACHIEVED GOOD RESULTS WHEN TESTED WITH POPULAR DATASETS. HOWEVER, IT WILL BE CHALLENGING TO BUILD A CORPUS ON NEW TOPICS TO TRAIN MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS IN SENTIMENT CLASSIFICATION WITH HIGH CONFIDENCE. THIS STUDY PROPOSES A METHOD THAT PROCESSES EMBEDDING KNOWLEDGE IN THE ONTOLOGY OF OPINION DATASETS CALLED KNOWLEDGE PROCESSING AND REPRESENTATION BASED ON ONTOLOGY (KPRO) TO REPRESENT THE SIGNIFICANT FEATURES OF THE DATASET INTO THE WORD EMBEDDING LAYER OF DEEP LEARNING ALGORITHMS IN SENTIMENT CLASSIFICATION. UNLIKE THE METHODS THAT LEXICAL ENCODE OR ADD INFORMATION TO THE CORPUS, THIS METHOD ADDS PRESENTATION OF RAW DATA BASED ON THE EXPERT'S KNOWLEDGE IN THE ONTOLOGY. ONCE THE DATA HAS A RICH KNOWLEDGE OF THE TOPIC, THE EFFICIENCY OF THE MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS IS SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCED. THUS, THIS METHOD IS APPLIABLE TO EMBED KNOWLEDGE IN DATASETS IN OTHER LANGUAGES. THE TEST RESULTS SHOW THAT DEEP LEARNING METHODS ACHIEVED CONSIDERABLY HIGHER ACCURACY WHEN TRAINED WITH THE KPRO METHOD'S DATASET THAN WHEN TRAINED WITH DATASETS NOT PROCESSED BY THIS METHOD. THEREFORE, THIS METHOD IS A NOVEL APPROACH TO IMPROVE THE ACCURACY OF DEEP LEARNING ALGORITHMS AND INCREASE THE RELIABILITY OF NEW DATASETS, THUS MAKING THEM READY FOR MINING.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
EMCBOW-GPCR: A METHOD FOR IDENTIFYING G-PROTEIN COUPLED RECEPTORS BASED ON WORD EMBEDDING AND WORDBOOKS. G PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS (GPCRS) ARE ONE OF THE LARGEST MEMBRANE PROTEIN RECEPTOR FAMILY IN HUMAN, WHICH ARE ALSO IMPORTANT TARGETS FOR MANY DRUGS. THENCE, IT'S OF GREAT SIGNIFICANCE TO JUDGE WHETHER A PROTEIN IS A GPCR OR NOT. HOWEVER, IDENTIFYING GPCRS BY EXPERIMENTAL METHODS IS VERY EXPENSIVE AND TIME-CONSUMING. AS MORE AND MORE GPCR PRIMARY SEQUENCES ARE ACCUMULATED, IT'S FEASIBLE TO DEVELOP A COMPUTATIONAL MODEL TO PREDICT GPCRS PRECISELY AND QUICKLY. IN THIS PAPER, A NOVEL METHOD CALLED EMCBOW-GPCR HAS BEEN PROPOSED TO IMPROVE THE ACCURACY OF IDENTIFYING GPCRS BASED ON NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP). FOR REPRESENTING GPCRS, THREE WORD-EMBEDDING MODELS AND A BAG-OF-WORDS MODEL ARE USED TO EXTRACT ORIGINAL FEATURES. THEN, THE ORIGINAL FEATURES ARE THROWN INTO A DEEP-LEARNING ALGORITHM TO EXTRACT FEATURES FURTHER AND REDUCE THE DIMENSION. FINALLY, THE OBTAINED FEATURES ARE FED INTO EXTREME GRADIENT BOOSTING. AS SHOWN WITH THE RESULTS COMPARISON, THE OVERALL PREDICTION METRICS OF EMCBOW-GPCR ARE HIGHER THAN THE STATE OF THE ARTS. IN ORDER TO BE CONVENIENT FOR MORE RESEARCHERS TO USE EMCBOW-GPCR, THE METHOD AND SOURCE CODE HAVE BEEN OPENED IN GITHUB, WHICH ARE AVAILABLE AT HTTPS://GITHUB.COM/454170054/EMCBOW-GPCR, AND A USER-FRIENDLY WEB-SERVER FOR EMCBOW-GPCR HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED AT HTTP://WWW.JCI-BIOINFO.CN/EMCBOWGPCR.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
EMDLP: ENSEMBLE MULTISCALE DEEP LEARNING MODEL FOR RNA METHYLATION SITE PREDICTION. BACKGROUND: RECENT RESEARCH RECOMMENDS THAT EPI-TRANSCRIPTOME REGULATION THROUGH POST-TRANSCRIPTIONAL RNA MODIFICATIONS IS ESSENTIAL FOR ALL SORTS OF RNA. EXACT IDENTIFICATION OF RNA MODIFICATION IS VITAL FOR UNDERSTANDING THEIR PURPOSES AND REGULATORY MECHANISMS. HOWEVER, TRADITIONAL EXPERIMENTAL METHODS OF IDENTIFYING RNA MODIFICATION SITES ARE RELATIVELY COMPLICATED, TIME-CONSUMING, AND LABORIOUS. MACHINE LEARNING APPROACHES HAVE BEEN APPLIED IN THE PROCEDURES OF RNA SEQUENCE FEATURES EXTRACTION AND CLASSIFICATION IN A COMPUTATIONAL WAY, WHICH MAY SUPPLEMENT EXPERIMENTAL APPROACHES MORE EFFICIENTLY. RECENTLY, CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (CNN) AND LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY (LSTM) HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATED ACHIEVEMENTS IN MODIFICATION SITE PREDICTION ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR POWERFUL FUNCTIONS IN REPRESENTATION LEARNING. HOWEVER, CNN CAN LEARN THE LOCAL RESPONSE FROM THE SPATIAL DATA BUT CANNOT LEARN SEQUENTIAL CORRELATIONS. AND LSTM IS SPECIALIZED FOR SEQUENTIAL MODELING AND CAN ACCESS BOTH THE CONTEXTUAL REPRESENTATION BUT LACKS SPATIAL DATA EXTRACTION COMPARED WITH CNN. THERE IS STRONG MOTIVATION TO CONSTRUCT A PREDICTION FRAMEWORK USING NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP), DEEP LEARNING (DL) FOR THESE REASONS. RESULTS: THIS STUDY PRESENTS AN ENSEMBLE MULTISCALE DEEP LEARNING PREDICTOR (EMDLP) TO IDENTIFY RNA METHYLATION SITES IN AN NLP AND DL WAY. IT ORGANICALLY COMBINES THE DILATED CONVOLUTION AND BIDIRECTIONAL LSTM (BILSTM), WHICH HELPS TO TAKE BETTER ADVANTAGE OF THE LOCAL AND GLOBAL INFORMATION FOR SITE PREDICTION. THE FIRST STEP OF EMDLP IS TO REPRESENT THE RNA SEQUENCES IN AN NLP WAY. THUS, THREE ENCODINGS, E.G., RNA WORD EMBEDDING, ONE-HOT ENCODING, AND RGLOVE, WHICH IS AN IMPROVED LEARNING METHOD OF WORD VECTOR REPRESENTATION BASED ON GLOVE, ARE ADOPTED TO DECIPHER SITES FROM THE VIEWPOINTS OF THE LOCAL AND GLOBAL INFORMATION. THEN, A DILATED CONVOLUTIONAL BIDIRECTIONAL LSTM NETWORK (DCB) MODEL IS CONSTRUCTED WITH THE DILATED CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (DCNN) FOLLOWED BY BILSTM TO EXTRACT POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTING FEATURES FOR METHYLATION SITE PREDICTION. FINALLY, THESE THREE ENCODING METHODS ARE INTEGRATED BY A SOFT VOTE TO OBTAIN BETTER PREDICTIVE PERFORMANCE. EXPERIMENT RESULTS ON M(1)A AND M(6)A REVEAL THAT THE AREA UNDER THE RECEIVER OPERATING CHARACTERISTIC(AUROC) OF EMDLP OBTAINS RESPECTIVELY 95.56%, 85.24%, AND OUTPERFORMS THE STATE-OF-THE-ART MODELS. TO MAXIMIZE USER CONVENIENCE, A USER-FRIENDLY WEBSERVER FOR EMDLP WAS PUBLICLY AVAILABLE AT HTTP://WWW.LABIIP.NET/EMDLP/INDEX.PHP ( HTTP://47.104.130.81/EMDLP/INDEX.PHP ). CONCLUSIONS: WE DEVELOPED A PREDICTOR FOR M(1)A AND M(6)A METHYLATION SITES.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT DISPOSITION PREDICTION USING A DEEP NEURAL NETWORK WITH INTEGRATED CLINICAL NARRATIVES AND STRUCTURED DATA. BACKGROUND: EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT (ED) OVERCROWDING HAS BEEN A SERIOUS ISSUE AND DEMANDS EFFECTIVE CLINICAL DECISION-MAKING OF PATIENT DISPOSITION. IN PREVIOUS STUDIES, EMERGENCY CLINICAL NARRATIVES PROVIDE A RICH CONTEXT FOR CLINICAL DECISIONS. WE AIMED TO DEVELOP THE DISPOSITION PREDICTION MODEL USING DEEP LEARNING MODELING STRATEGY WITH THE HETEROGENEOUS DATA, INCLUDING THE PHYSICIANS' NARRATIVES. METHODS: WE CONSTRUCTED A RETROSPECTIVE COHORT OF ALL 104,083 ED VISITS OF NON-TRAUMA ADULTS DURING 2017-18 FROM AN ACADEMICALLY AFFILIATED ED IN TAIWAN. 18,308 VISITS WERE EXCLUDED BASED ON THE COMPLETENESS OF EACH RECORD AND THE UNPREDICTABLE DISPOSITIONS, SUCH AS OUT-OF-HOSPITAL CARDIAC ARREST, AGAINST-ADVICE DISCHARGE, AND ESCAPES. WE INTEGRATED SUBJECTIVE SECTION OF THE FIRST PHYSICIANS' CLINICAL NARRATIVES AND STRUCTURED DATA (E.G., DEMOGRAPHICS, TRIAGE VITAL SIGNS, ETC.) AS AVAILABLE PREDICTORS AT THE FIRST PHYSICIAN-PATIENT ENCOUNTER. TO PREDICT FINAL PATIENT DISPOSITION (I.E., HOSPITALIZATION OR DISCHARGE), A DEEP NEURAL NETWORK (DNN) MODEL WAS DEVELOPED WITH WORD EMBEDDING, A COMMON NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING METHOD. WE COMPARED THE PROPOSED MODEL TO A REFERENCE MODEL USING THE RAPID EMERGENCY MEDICINE SCORE, A LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODEL WITH STRUCTURED DATA, AND A DNN MODEL WITH PARAGRAPH VECTORS. F1 SCORE WAS USED TO MEASURE THE PREDICTIVE PERFORMANCE FOR EACH MODEL. RESULTS: THE F1 SCORE (WITH 95 % CI) FOR THE PROPOSED MODEL, THE REFERENCE MODEL, THE LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODEL WITH STRUCTURED DATA, AND THE DNN MODEL WITH PARAGRAPH VECTORS WERE 0.674 (0.669-0.679), 0.474 (0.469-0.479), 0.547 (0.543-0.551), AND 0.602 (0.596-0.607), RESPECTIVELY. WHILE ANALYZING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CONTEXT LENGTH AND PREDICTIVE PERFORMANCE UNDER THE PROPOSED MODEL, THE F1 SCORE AT 95TH PERCENTILE OF THE WORD COUNTS WAS HIGHER THAN THAT AT 25TH PERCENTILE OF THE WORD COUNTS IN CHIEF COMPLAINT [0.634 (0.629-0.640) VS. 0.624 (0.620-0.628)] AND IN PRESENT ILLNESS [0.671 (0.667-0.674) VS. 0.654 (0.651-0.658)], BUT NOT IN PAST MEDICAL HISTORY [0.674 (0.669-0.679) VS. 0.673 (0.666-0.679)]. CONCLUSIONS: THE PROPOSED DEEP LEARNING MODEL WITH THE USAGE OF THE FIRST PHYSICIANS' CLINICAL NARRATIVES AND STRUCTURED DATA BASED ON NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING OUTPERFORMED THE COMMONLY USED ONES IN TERMS OF F1 SCORE. IT ALSO EVIDENCED THE IMPORTANCE OF THE SUBJECTIVE SECTION OF CLINICAL NARRATIVES, WHICH SERVE AS VITAL PREDICTORS FOR ED CLINICAL DECISION-MAKING.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
ENGLISH COLOUR TERMS CARRY GENDER AND VALENCE BIASES: A CORPUS STUDY USING WORD EMBEDDINGS. IN WESTERN SOCIETIES, THE STEREOTYPE PREVAILS THAT PINK IS FOR GIRLS AND BLUE IS FOR BOYS. A THIRD POSSIBLE GENDERED COLOUR IS RED. WHILE LIKED BY WOMEN, IT REPRESENTS POWER, STEREOTYPICALLY A MASCULINE CHARACTERISTIC. EMPIRICAL STUDIES CONFIRMED SUCH GENDERED CONNOTATIONS WHEN TESTING COLOUR-EMOTION ASSOCIATIONS OR COLOUR PREFERENCES IN MALES AND FEMALES. FURTHERMORE, EMPIRICAL STUDIES DEMONSTRATED THAT PINK IS A POSITIVE COLOUR, BLUE IS MAINLY A POSITIVE COLOUR, AND RED IS BOTH A POSITIVE AND A NEGATIVE COLOUR. HERE, WE ASSESSED IF THE SAME VALENCE AND GENDER CONNOTATIONS APPEAR IN WIDELY AVAILABLE WRITTEN TEXTS (WIKIPEDIA AND NEWSWIRE ARTICLES). USING A WORD EMBEDDING METHOD (GLOVE), WE EXTRACTED GENDER AND VALENCE BIASES FOR BLUE, PINK, AND RED, AS WELL AS FOR THE REMAINING BASIC COLOUR TERMS FROM A LARGE ENGLISH-LANGUAGE CORPUS CONTAINING SIX BILLION WORDS. WE FOUND AND CONFIRMED THAT PINK WAS BIASED TOWARDS FEMININITY AND POSITIVITY, AND BLUE WAS BIASED TOWARDS POSITIVITY. WE FOUND NO STRONG GENDER BIAS FOR BLUE, AND NO STRONG GENDER OR VALENCE BIASES FOR RED. FOR THE REMAINING COLOUR TERMS, WE ONLY FOUND THAT GREEN, WHITE, AND BROWN WERE POSITIVELY BIASED. OUR FINDING ON PINK SHOWS THAT WRITERS OF WIDELY AVAILABLE ENGLISH TEXTS USE THIS COLOUR TERM TO CONVEY FEMININITY. THIS GENDERED COMMUNICATION REINFORCES THE NOTION THAT RESULTS FROM RESEARCH STUDIES FIND THEIR ANALOGUE IN REAL WORD PHENOMENA. OTHER FINDINGS WERE EITHER CONSISTENT OR INCONSISTENT WITH RESULTS FROM RESEARCH STUDIES. WE ARGUE THAT WIDELY AVAILABLE WRITTEN TEXTS HAVE BIASES ON THEIR OWN, BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN FILTERED ACCORDING TO CONTEXT, TIME, AND WHAT IS APPROPRIATE TO BE REPORTED.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
ENGLISH SPEAKERS' IMPLICIT GENDER CONCEPTS INFLUENCE THEIR PROCESSING OF FRENCH GRAMMATICAL GENDER: EVIDENCE FOR SEMANTICALLY MEDIATED CROSS-LINGUISTIC INFLUENCE. SECOND LANGUAGE (L2) LEARNERS OFTEN SHOW INFLUENCE FROM THEIR FIRST LANGUAGE (L1) IN ALL DOMAINS OF LANGUAGE. THIS CROSS-LINGUISTIC INFLUENCE COULD, IN SOME CASES, BE MEDIATED BY SEMANTICS. THE PURPOSE OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO TEST WHETHER IMPLICIT ENGLISH GENDER CONNOTATIONS AFFECT L1 ENGLISH SPEAKERS' JUDGMENTS OF THE L2 FRENCH GENDER OF OBJECTS. WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT GENDER ESTIMATES DERIVED FROM WORD EMBEDDING MODELS THAT MEASURE SIMILARITY OF WORD CONTEXTS IN ENGLISH WOULD AFFECT ACCURACY AND RESPONSE TIME ON GRAMMATICAL GENDER (GG) DECISION IN L2 FRENCH. L2 FRENCH LEARNERS WERE ASKED TO IDENTIFY THE GG OF FRENCH WORDS ESTIMATED TO BE EITHER CONGRUENT OR INCONGRUENT WITH THE IMPLICIT GENDER IN ENGLISH. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT THEY WERE MORE ACCURATE WITH WORDS THAT WERE CONGRUENT WITH ENGLISH GENDER CONNOTATIONS THAN WORDS THAT WERE INCONGRUENT, SUGGESTING THAT ENGLISH GENDER CONNOTATIONS CAN INFLUENCE GRAMMATICAL JUDGMENTS IN FRENCH. RESPONSE TIMES SHOWED THE SAME PATTERN. THE RESULTS ARE CONSISTENT WITH SEMANTICS-MEDIATED CROSS-LINGUISTIC INFLUENCE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
ENHANCED PROTEIN STRUCTURAL CLASS PREDICTION USING EFFECTIVE FEATURE MODELING AND ENSEMBLE OF CLASSIFIERS. PROTEIN SECONDARY STRUCTURAL CLASS (PSSC) INFORMATION IS IMPORTANT IN INVESTIGATING FURTHER CHALLENGES OF PROTEIN SEQUENCES LIKE PROTEIN FOLD RECOGNITION, PROTEIN TERTIARY STRUCTURE PREDICTION, AND ANALYSIS OF PROTEIN FUNCTIONS FOR DRUG DISCOVERY. IDENTIFICATION OF PSSC USING BIOLOGICAL METHODS IS TIME-CONSUMING AND COST-INTENSIVE. SEVERAL COMPUTATIONAL MODELS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED TO PREDICT THE STRUCTURAL CLASS; HOWEVER, THEY LACK IN GENERALIZATION OF THE MODEL. HENCE, PREDICTING PSSC BASED ON PROTEIN SEQUENCES IS STILL PROVING TO BE AN UPHILL TASK. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE PROPOSED AN EFFECTIVE, NOVEL AND GENERALIZED PREDICTION MODEL CONSISTING OF A FEATURE MODELING AND AN ENSEMBLE OF CLASSIFIERS. THE PROPOSED FEATURE MODELING EXTRACTS DISCRIMINATING INFORMATION (FEATURES) BY LEVERAGING THREE TECHNIQUES: (I) EMBEDDING - FEATURES ARE EXTRACTED ON THE BASIS OF SPATIAL RESIDUE ARRANGEMENTS OF THE SEQUENCES USING WORD EMBEDDING APPROACHES; (II) SKIPXGRAM BI-GRAM - VARIOUS SETS OF SKIPPED BI-GRAM FEATURES ARE EXTRACTED FROM THE SEQUENCES; AND (III) GENERAL STATISTICAL (GS) BASED FEATURES ARE EXTRACTED WHICH COVERS THE GLOBAL INFORMATION OF STRUCTURAL SEQUENCES. THE COMBINED EFFECTIVE SETS OF FEATURES ARE TRAINED AND CLASSIFIED USING AN ENSEMBLE OF THREE CLASSIFIERS: SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE (SVM), RANDOM FOREST (RF), AND GRADIENT BOOSTING MACHINES (GBM). THE PROPOSED MODEL WHEN ASSESSED ON FIVE BENCHMARK DATASETS (HIGH AND LOW SEQUENCE SIMILARITY), VIZ.

THE PROPOSED MODEL IS FURTHER VALIDATED ON A LARGE-SCALE UPDATED LOW SIMILARITY ( </= 25%) DATASET, WHERE IT ACHIEVED AN OVERALL ACCURACY OF 81.11 PERCENT.

ENHANCING CLINICAL CONCEPT EXTRACTION WITH CONTEXTUAL EMBEDDINGS. OBJECTIVE: NEURAL NETWORK-BASED REPRESENTATIONS ("EMBEDDINGS") HAVE DRAMATICALLY ADVANCED NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) TASKS, INCLUDING CLINICAL NLP TASKS SUCH AS CONCEPT EXTRACTION. RECENTLY, HOWEVER, MORE ADVANCED EMBEDDING METHODS AND REPRESENTATIONS (EG, ELMO, BERT) HAVE FURTHER PUSHED THE STATE OF THE ART IN NLP, YET THERE ARE NO COMMON BEST PRACTICES FOR HOW TO INTEGRATE THESE REPRESENTATIONS INTO CLINICAL TASKS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY, THEN, IS TO EXPLORE THE SPACE OF POSSIBLE OPTIONS IN UTILIZING THESE NEW MODELS FOR CLINICAL CONCEPT EXTRACTION, INCLUDING COMPARING THESE TO TRADITIONAL WORD EMBEDDING METHODS (WORD2VEC, GLOVE, FASTTEXT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: BOTH OFF-THE-SHELF, OPEN-DOMAIN EMBEDDINGS AND PRETRAINED CLINICAL EMBEDDINGS FROM MIMIC-III (MEDICAL INFORMATION MART FOR INTENSIVE CARE III) ARE EVALUATED. WE EXPLORE A BATTERY OF EMBEDDING METHODS CONSISTING OF TRADITIONAL WORD EMBEDDINGS AND CONTEXTUAL EMBEDDINGS AND COMPARE THESE ON 4 CONCEPT EXTRACTION CORPORA: I2B2 2010, I2B2 2012, SEMEVAL 2014, AND SEMEVAL 2015. WE ALSO ANALYZE THE IMPACT OF THE PRETRAINING TIME OF A LARGE LANGUAGE MODEL LIKE ELMO OR BERT ON THE EXTRACTION PERFORMANCE. LAST, WE PRESENT AN INTUITIVE WAY TO UNDERSTAND THE SEMANTIC INFORMATION ENCODED BY CONTEXTUAL EMBEDDINGS. RESULTS: CONTEXTUAL EMBEDDINGS PRETRAINED ON A LARGE CLINICAL CORPUS ACHIEVES NEW STATE-OF-THE-ART PERFORMANCES ACROSS ALL CONCEPT EXTRACTION TASKS. THE BEST-PERFORMING MODEL OUTPERFORMS ALL STATE-OF-THE-ART METHODS WITH RESPECTIVE F1-MEASURES OF 90.25, 93.18 (PARTIAL), 80.74, AND 81.65. CONCLUSIONS: WE DEMONSTRATE THE POTENTIAL OF CONTEXTUAL EMBEDDINGS THROUGH THE STATE-OF-THE-ART PERFORMANCE THESE METHODS ACHIEVE ON CLINICAL CONCEPT EXTRACTION. ADDITIONALLY, WE DEMONSTRATE THAT CONTEXTUAL EMBEDDINGS ENCODE VALUABLE SEMANTIC INFORMATION NOT ACCOUNTED FOR IN TRADITIONAL WORD REPRESENTATIONS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
ENHANCING PREDICTION MODELS FOR ONE-YEAR MORTALITY IN PATIENTS WITH ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION AND POST MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION SYNDROME. PREDICTING THE RISK OF MORTALITY FOR PATIENTS WITH ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION (AMI) USING ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS (EHRS) DATA CAN HELP IDENTIFY RISKY PATIENTS WHO MIGHT NEED MORE TAILORED CARE. IN OUR PREVIOUS WORK, WE BUILT COMPUTATIONAL MODELS TO PREDICT ONE-YEAR MORTALITY OF PATIENTS ADMITTED TO AN INTENSIVE CARE UNIT (ICU) WITH AMI OR POST MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION SYNDROME. OUR PRIOR WORK ONLY USED THE STRUCTURED CLINICAL DATA FROM MIMIC-III, A PUBLICLY AVAILABLE ICU CLINICAL DATABASE. IN THIS STUDY, WE ENHANCED OUR WORK BY ADDING THE WORD EMBEDDING FEATURES FROM FREE-TEXT DISCHARGE SUMMARIES. USING A RICHER SET OF FEATURES RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR DEEP LEARNING MODELS. THE AVERAGE ACCURACY OF OUR DEEP LEARNING MODELS WAS 92.89% AND THE AVERAGE F-MEASURE WAS 0.928. WE FURTHER REPORTED THE IMPACT OF DIFFERENT COMBINATIONS OF FEATURES EXTRACTED FROM STRUCTURED AND/OR UNSTRUCTURED DATA ON THE PERFORMANCE OF THE DEEP LEARNING MODELS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
ENTROPY-BASED APPROACH FOR THE DETECTION OF CHANGES IN ARABIC NEWSPAPERS' CONTENT. A NEW METHOD FOR THE RECOGNITION OF MEANINGFUL CHANGES IN SOCIAL STATE BASED ON TRANSFORMATIONS OF THE LINGUISTIC CONTENT IN ARABIC NEWSPAPERS IS SUGGESTED. THE DETECTED ALTERATIONS OF THE LINGUISTIC MATERIAL IN ARABIC NEWSPAPERS PLAY AN INDICATOR ROLE. THE CURRENTLY PROPOSED APPROACH ACTS IN AN "ONLINE" FASHION AND USES PRE-TRAINED VECTOR REPRESENTATIONS OF ARABIC WORDS. AFTER A PRE-PROCESSING STAGE, THE WORDS IN THE ISSUES' TEXTS ARE SUBSTITUTED BY VECTORS OBTAINED WITHIN A WORD EMBEDDING METHODOLOGY. THE APPROACH TYPIFIES THE CONSISTENT LINGUISTIC TEMPLATE BY THE SIMILARITY OF THE EMBEDDED VECTORS. A CHANGE IN THE DISTRIBUTIONS OF THE ISSUE-GROUNDED SAMPLES INDICATES A DIFFERENCE IN THE UNDERLYING NEWSPAPER TEMPLATE. A TWO-STEP PROCEDURE IMPLEMENTS THE CONCEPT, WHERE THE FIRST STEP COMPARES THE SIMILARITY DISTRIBUTION OF THE CURRENT ISSUE VERSUS THE UNION OF ONES CORRESPONDING TO SEVERAL OF ITS PREDECESSORS. A REPEATING UNDER-SAMPLING APPROACH ACCOMPANIED BY A TWO-SAMPLE TEST STABILIZES THE SAMPLING AND RETURNS A COLLECTION OF THE RESULTANT P-VALUES. IN THE SECOND STAGE, THE ENTROPY OF THESE SETS IS SEQUENTIALLY CALCULATED, SUCH THAT THE CHANGE POINTS OF THE TIME SERIES OBTAINED IN THIS WAY INDICATE THE CHANGES IN THE NEWSPAPER CONTENT. NUMERICAL EXPERIMENTS PROVIDED ON THE FOLLOWING ISSUES OF SEVERAL ARABIC NEWSPAPERS PUBLISHED IN THE ARAB SPRING PERIOD DEMONSTRATE THE HIGH RELIABILITY OF THE METHOD.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS OF NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING: WHAT THE RADIOLOGIST SHOULD KNOW. NATURAL LANGUAGE IS UBIQUITOUS IN THE WORKFLOW OF MEDICAL IMAGING. RADIOLOGISTS CREATE AND CONSUME FREE TEXT IN THEIR DAILY WORK, SOME OF WHICH CAN BE AMENABLE TO ENHANCEMENTS THROUGH AUTOMATIC PROCESSING. RECENT ADVANCEMENTS IN DEEP LEARNING AND "ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE" HAVE HAD A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE IMPACT ON NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP). THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE HISTORY OF HOW RESEARCHERS HAVE EXTRACTED DATA AND ENCODED NATURAL LANGUAGE INFORMATION FOR ANALYTICAL PROCESSING, STARTING FROM NLP'S HUMBLE ORIGINS IN HAND-CURATED, LINGUISTIC RULES. THE EVOLUTION OF MEDICAL NLP INCLUDING VECTORIZATION, WORD EMBEDDING, CLASSIFICATION, AS WELL AS ITS USE IN AUTOMATED SPEECH RECOGNITION, ARE ALSO EXPLORED. FINALLY, THE ARTICLE WILL DISCUSS THE ROLE OF MACHINE LEARNING AND NEURAL NETWORKS IN THE CONTEXT OF SIGNIFICANT, IF INCREMENTAL, IMPROVEMENTS IN NLP.

ESTIMATION OF THE PREVALENCE OF ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS FROM SOCIAL MEDIA. THIS WORK AIMS TO ESTIMATE THE DEGREE OF ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS (ADR) FOR PSYCHIATRIC MEDICATIONS FROM SOCIAL MEDIA, INCLUDING TWITTER, REDDIT, AND LIVEJOURNAL. ADVANCES IN LIGHTNING-FAST CLUSTER COMPUTING WAS EMPLOYED TO PROCESS LARGE SCALE DATA, CONSISTING OF 6.4 TERABYTES OF DATA CONTAINING 3.8 BILLION RECORDS FROM ALL THE MEDIA. RATES OF ADR WERE QUANTIFIED USING THE SIDER DATABASE OF DRUGS AND SIDE-EFFECTS, AND AN ESTIMATED ADR RATE WAS BASED ON THE PREVALENCE OF DISCUSSION IN THE SOCIAL MEDIA CORPORA. AGREEMENT BETWEEN THESE MEASURES FOR A SAMPLE OF TEN POPULAR PSYCHIATRIC DRUGS WAS EVALUATED USING THE PEARSON CORRELATION COEFFICIENT, R, WITH VALUES BETWEEN 0.08 AND 0.50. WORD2VEC, A NOVEL NEURAL LEARNING FRAMEWORK, WAS UTILIZED TO IMPROVE THE COVERAGE OF VARIANTS OF ADR TERMS IN THE UNSTRUCTURED TEXT BY IDENTIFYING SYNTACTICALLY OR SEMANTICALLY SIMILAR TERMS. IMPROVED CORRELATION COEFFICIENTS, BETWEEN 0.29 AND 0.59, DEMONSTRATES THE CAPABILITY OF ADVANCED TECHNIQUES IN MACHINE LEARNING TO AID IN THE DISCOVERY OF MEANINGFUL PATTERNS FROM MEDICAL DATA, AND SOCIAL MEDIA DATA, AT SCALE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
EVALUATING KEYPHRASE EXTRACTION ALGORITHMS FOR FINDING SIMILAR NEWS ARTICLES USING LEXICAL SIMILARITY CALCULATION AND SEMANTIC RELATEDNESS MEASUREMENT BY WORD EMBEDDING. A TEXTUAL DATA PROCESSING TASK THAT INVOLVES THE AUTOMATIC EXTRACTION OF RELEVANT AND SALIENT KEYPHRASES FROM A DOCUMENT THAT EXPRESSES ALL THE IMPORTANT CONCEPTS OF THE DOCUMENT IS CALLED KEYPHRASE EXTRACTION. DUE TO TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENTS, THE AMOUNT OF TEXTUAL INFORMATION ON THE INTERNET IS RAPIDLY INCREASING AS A LOT OF TEXTUAL INFORMATION IS PROCESSED ONLINE IN VARIOUS DOMAINS SUCH AS OFFICES, NEWS PORTALS, OR FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES. GIVEN THE EXPONENTIAL INCREASE OF NEWS ARTICLES ON THE INTERNET, MANUALLY SEARCHING FOR SIMILAR NEWS ARTICLES BY READING THE ENTIRE NEWS CONTENT THAT MATCHES THE USER'S INTERESTS HAS BECOME A TIME-CONSUMING AND TEDIOUS TASK. THEREFORE, AUTOMATICALLY FINDING SIMILAR NEWS ARTICLES CAN BE A SIGNIFICANT TASK IN TEXT PROCESSING. IN THIS CONTEXT, KEYPHRASE EXTRACTION ALGORITHMS CAN EXTRACT INFORMATION FROM NEWS ARTICLES. HOWEVER, SELECTING THE MOST APPROPRIATE ALGORITHM IS ALSO A PROBLEM. THEREFORE, THIS STUDY ANALYZES VARIOUS SUPERVISED AND UNSUPERVISED KEYPHRASE EXTRACTION ALGORITHMS, NAMELY KEA, KP-MINER, YAKE, MULTIPARTITERANK, TOPICRANK, AND TEKET, WHICH ARE USED TO EXTRACT KEYPHRASES FROM NEWS ARTICLES. THE EXTRACTED KEYPHRASES ARE USED TO COMPUTE LEXICAL AND SEMANTIC SIMILARITY TO FIND SIMILAR NEWS ARTICLES. THE LEXICAL SIMILARITY IS CALCULATED USING THE COSINE AND JACCARD SIMILARITY TECHNIQUES. IN ADDITION, SEMANTIC SIMILARITY IS CALCULATED USING A WORD EMBEDDING TECHNIQUE CALLED WORD2VEC IN COMBINATION WITH THE COSINE SIMILARITY MEASURE. THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS SHOW THAT THE KP-MINER KEYPHRASE EXTRACTION ALGORITHM, TOGETHER WITH THE COSINE SIMILARITY CALCULATION USING WORD2VEC (COSINE-WORD2VEC), OUTPERFORMS THE OTHER COMBINATIONS OF KEYPHRASE EXTRACTION ALGORITHMS AND SIMILARITY CALCULATION TECHNIQUES TO FIND SIMILAR NEWS ARTICLES. THE SIMILAR ARTICLES IDENTIFIED USING KPMINER AND THE COSINE SIMILARITY MEASURE WITH WORD2VEC APPEAR TO BE RELEVANT TO A PARTICULAR NEWS ARTICLE AND THUS SHOW SATISFACTORY PERFORMANCE WITH A NORMALIZED DISCOUNTED CUMULATIVE GAIN (NDCG) VALUE OF 0.97. THIS STUDY PROPOSES A METHOD FOR FINDING SIMILAR NEWS ARTICLES THAT CAN BE USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH OTHER METHODS ALREADY IN USE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
EVALUATING SEMANTIC RELATIONS IN NEURAL WORD EMBEDDINGS WITH BIOMEDICAL AND GENERAL DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE BASES. BACKGROUND: IN THE PAST FEW YEARS, NEURAL WORD EMBEDDINGS HAVE BEEN WIDELY USED IN TEXT MINING. HOWEVER, THE VECTOR REPRESENTATIONS OF WORD EMBEDDINGS MOSTLY ACT AS A BLACK BOX IN DOWNSTREAM APPLICATIONS USING THEM, THEREBY LIMITING THEIR INTERPRETABILITY. EVEN THOUGH WORD EMBEDDINGS ARE ABLE TO CAPTURE SEMANTIC REGULARITIES IN FREE TEXT DOCUMENTS, IT IS NOT CLEAR HOW DIFFERENT KINDS OF SEMANTIC RELATIONS ARE REPRESENTED BY WORD EMBEDDINGS AND HOW SEMANTICALLY-RELATED TERMS CAN BE RETRIEVED FROM WORD EMBEDDINGS. METHODS: TO IMPROVE THE TRANSPARENCY OF WORD EMBEDDINGS AND THE INTERPRETABILITY OF THE APPLICATIONS USING THEM, IN THIS STUDY, WE PROPOSE A NOVEL APPROACH FOR EVALUATING THE SEMANTIC RELATIONS IN WORD EMBEDDINGS USING EXTERNAL KNOWLEDGE BASES: WIKIPEDIA, WORDNET AND UNIFIED MEDICAL LANGUAGE SYSTEM (UMLS). WE TRAINED MULTIPLE WORD EMBEDDINGS USING HEALTH-RELATED ARTICLES IN WIKIPEDIA AND THEN EVALUATED THEIR PERFORMANCE IN THE ANALOGY AND SEMANTIC RELATION TERM RETRIEVAL TASKS. WE ALSO ASSESSED IF THE EVALUATION RESULTS DEPEND ON THE DOMAIN OF THE TEXTUAL CORPORA BY COMPARING THE EMBEDDINGS OF HEALTH-RELATED WIKIPEDIA ARTICLES WITH THOSE OF GENERAL WIKIPEDIA ARTICLES. RESULTS: REGARDING THE RETRIEVAL OF SEMANTIC RELATIONS, WE WERE ABLE TO RETRIEVE DIVERSE SEMANTIC RELATIONS IN THE NEAREST NEIGHBORS OF A GIVEN WORD. MEANWHILE, THE TWO POPULAR WORD EMBEDDING APPROACHES, WORD2VEC AND GLOVE, OBTAINED COMPARABLE RESULTS ON BOTH THE ANALOGY RETRIEVAL TASK AND THE SEMANTIC RELATION RETRIEVAL TASK, WHILE DEPENDENCY-BASED WORD EMBEDDINGS HAD MUCH WORSE PERFORMANCE IN BOTH TASKS. WE ALSO FOUND THAT THE WORD EMBEDDINGS TRAINED WITH HEALTH-RELATED WIKIPEDIA ARTICLES OBTAINED BETTER PERFORMANCE IN THE HEALTH-RELATED RELATION RETRIEVAL TASKS THAN THOSE TRAINED WITH GENERAL WIKIPEDIA ARTICLES. CONCLUSION: IT IS EVIDENT FROM THIS STUDY THAT WORD EMBEDDINGS CAN GROUP TERMS WITH DIVERSE SEMANTIC RELATIONS TOGETHER. THE DOMAIN OF THE TRAINING CORPUS DOES HAVE IMPACT ON THE SEMANTIC RELATIONS REPRESENTED BY WORD EMBEDDINGS. WE THUS RECOMMEND USING DOMAIN-SPECIFIC CORPUS TO TRAIN WORD EMBEDDINGS FOR DOMAIN-SPECIFIC TEXT MINING TASKS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
EVALUATION OF DOCUMENT RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS ON A MEDICAL CORPUS IN FRENCH: INDEXATION VS. FEATURE LEARNING. THIS PAPER PRESENTS FIVE DOCUMENT RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS FOR A SMALL (FEW THOUSANDS) AND DOMAIN SPECIFIC CORPORA (WEEKLY PEER-REVIEWED MEDICAL JOURNALS PUBLISHED IN FRENCH) AS WELL AS AN EVALUATION METHODOLOGY TO QUANTIFY THE MODELS PERFORMANCE. THE PROPOSED METHODOLOGY DOES NOT RELY ON EXTERNAL ANNOTATIONS AND THEREFORE CAN BE USED AS AN AD HOC EVALUATION PROCEDURE FOR MOST DOCUMENT RETRIEVAL TASKS. STATISTICAL MODELS AND VECTOR SPACE MODELS ARE EMPIRICALLY COMPARED ON A SYNTHETIC DOCUMENT RETRIEVAL TASK. FOR OUR DATASET SIZE AND SPECIFICITIES THE STATISTICAL APPROACHES CONSISTENTLY PERFORMED BETTER THAN ITS VECTOR SPACE COUNTERPARTS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
EVOLUTION AND DIFFUSION OF INFORMATION LITERACY TOPICS. INVESTIGATION OF THE TOPIC OF INFORMATION LITERACY AND ITS CHANGES CAN BE INFORMATIVE FOR RESEARCHERS AND PROVIDE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE CORRESPONDING DOMAINS. THIS STUDY CONDUCTED A TOPIC MODEL DYNAMIC ANALYSIS OF THE ARTICLES ON INFORMATION LITERACY STUDIES IN THE WEB OF SCIENCE CORE COLLECTION DATABASE THAT WERE PUBLISHED FROM 2005 TO 2019. THE GLOBAL TOPICS AND THEIR POPULARITIES, TOPICAL SIMILARITIES AND CORRELATIONS, ALONG WITH THE EVOLUTION OF TEMPORAL LOCAL TOPICS AND THE DIFFUSION OF SUBJECT LOCAL TOPICS WERE ANALYZED AND PRESENTED. NINE GLOBAL TOPICS DIFFERED IN TERMS OF THEIR TEMPORAL AND SUBJECT CHARACTERISTICS, AND THIS STUDY FOCUSED ON ABILITY, TECHNOLOGY, FIELD, PEOPLE, PLACE AND APPLICATION OF INFORMATION LITERACY. FOR THE TEMPORAL LOCAL TOPICS, CROSSING WAS THE MAIN EVOLUTIONARY MECHANISM; HENCE, THE CORE TOPIC WORDS WERE RELATIVELY STABLE, BUT FEW NEW RESEARCH DIRECTIONS HAVE BEEN EXPLORED IN RECENT YEARS. FOR THE SUBJECT LOCAL TOPICS, ABSORBING WITH DIVISION AND ABSORBING WERE THE MAIN MECHANISMS, WHICH SUPPORTED THE DIFFUSION PROGRESS OF INFORMATION LITERACY STUDIES AMONG SUBJECTS. HOWEVER, IT IS NECESSARY TO PROMOTE THE DEVELOPMENT OF FUTURE RESEARCH THROUGH THE INNOVATIVE DEVELOPMENT OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY INTEGRATION. RESEARCHERS AND PRACTITIONERS SHOULD FOCUS ON THE IMPACT OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, INCREASE THE BREADTH AND DEPTH OF THE RESEARCH FIELD, AND DEVELOP INNOVATIVE EVALUATION METHODS THAT ARE BASED ON DATA TO PROMOTE THE COMPREHENSIVE, SUSTAINABLE AND EFFECTIVE IMPROVEMENT IN INFORMATION LITERACY.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
EVOLUTION OF EMOTION SEMANTICS. HUMANS POSSESS THE UNIQUE ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE EMOTIONS THROUGH LANGUAGE. ALTHOUGH CONCEPTS LIKE ANGER OR AWE ARE ABSTRACT, THERE IS A SHARED CONSENSUS ABOUT WHAT THESE ENGLISH EMOTION WORDS MEAN. THIS CONSENSUS MAY GIVE THE IMPRESSION THAT THEIR MEANING IS STATIC, BUT WE PROPOSE THIS IS NOT THE CASE. WE CANNOT TRAVEL BACK TO EARLIER PERIODS TO STUDY EMOTION CONCEPTS DIRECTLY, BUT WE CAN EXAMINE TEXT CORPORA, WHICH HAVE PARTIALLY PRESERVED THE MEANING OF EMOTION WORDS. USING NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING OF HISTORICAL TEXT, WE FOUND EVIDENCE FOR SEMANTIC CHANGE IN EMOTION WORDS OVER THE PAST CENTURY AND THAT VARYING RATES OF CHANGE WERE PREDICTED IN PART BY AN EMOTION CONCEPT'S PROTOTYPICALITY-HOW REPRESENTATIVE IT IS OF THE BROADER CATEGORY OF "EMOTION". PROTOTYPICALITY NEGATIVELY CORRELATED WITH HISTORICAL RATES OF EMOTION SEMANTIC CHANGE OBTAINED FROM TEXT-BASED WORD EMBEDDINGS, BEYOND MORE ESTABLISHED VARIABLES INCLUDING USAGE FREQUENCY IN ENGLISH AND A SECOND COMPARISON LANGUAGE, FRENCH. THIS EFFECT FOR PROTOTYPICALITY DID NOT CONSISTENTLY EXTEND TO THE SEMANTIC CATEGORY OF BIRDS, SUGGESTING ITS RELEVANCE FOR PREDICTING SEMANTIC CHANGE MAY BE CATEGORY-DEPENDENT. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST EMOTION SEMANTICS ARE EVOLVING OVER TIME, WITH PROTOTYPICAL EMOTION WORDS REMAINING SEMANTICALLY STABLE, WHILE OTHER EMOTION WORDS EVOLVE MORE FREELY.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
EXPANDING OUR UNDERSTANDING OF COVID-19 FROM BIOMEDICAL LITERATURE USING WORD EMBEDDING. A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 2019 (COVID-19) IS URGENTLY REQUIRED TO ADDRESS THIS HEALTH CRISIS. NUMEROUS RESEARCHERS AND PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES ARE WORKING ON DEVELOPING VACCINES AND TREATMENTS; HOWEVER, A CLEAR SOLUTION HAS YET TO BE FOUND. THE CURRENT STUDY PROPOSES THE USE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE METHODS TO COMPREHEND BIOMEDICAL KNOWLEDGE AND INFER THE CHARACTERISTICS OF COVID-19. A BIOMEDICAL KNOWLEDGE BASE WAS ESTABLISHED VIA FASTTEXT, A WORD EMBEDDING TECHNIQUE, USING PUBMED LITERATURE FROM THE PAST DECADE. SUBSEQUENTLY, A NEW KNOWLEDGE BASE WAS CREATED USING RECENTLY PUBLISHED COVID-19 ARTICLES. USING THIS NEWLY CONSTRUCTED KNOWLEDGE BASE FROM THE WORD EMBEDDING MODEL, A LIST OF ANTI-INFECTIVE DRUGS AND PROTEINS OF EITHER HUMAN OR CORONAVIRUS ORIGIN WERE INFERRED TO BE RELATED, BECAUSE THEY ARE LOCATED CLOSE TO COVID-19 ON THE KNOWLEDGE BASE. THIS STUDY ATTEMPTED TO FORM A METHOD TO QUICKLY INFER RELATED INFORMATION ABOUT COVID-19 USING THE EXISTING KNOWLEDGE BASE, BEFORE SUFFICIENT KNOWLEDGE ABOUT COVID-19 IS ACCUMULATED. WITH COVID-19 NOT COMPLETELY OVERCOME, MACHINE LEARNING-BASED RESEARCH IN THE PUBMED LITERATURE WILL PROVIDE A BROAD GUIDELINE FOR RESEARCHERS AND PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES WORKING ON TREATMENTS FOR COVID-19.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
EXPLORING THE PRIVACY-PRESERVING PROPERTIES OF WORD EMBEDDINGS: ALGORITHMIC VALIDATION STUDY. BACKGROUND: WORD EMBEDDINGS ARE DENSE NUMERIC VECTORS USED TO REPRESENT LANGUAGE IN NEURAL NETWORKS. UNTIL RECENTLY, THERE HAD BEEN NO PUBLICLY RELEASED EMBEDDINGS TRAINED ON CLINICAL DATA. OUR WORK IS THE FIRST TO STUDY THE PRIVACY IMPLICATIONS OF RELEASING THESE MODELS. OBJECTIVE: THIS PAPER AIMS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT TRADITIONAL WORD EMBEDDINGS CREATED ON CLINICAL CORPORA THAT HAVE BEEN DEIDENTIFIED BY REMOVING PERSONAL HEALTH INFORMATION (PHI) CAN NONETHELESS BE EXPLOITED TO REVEAL SENSITIVE PATIENT INFORMATION. METHODS: WE USED EMBEDDINGS CREATED FROM 400,000 DOCTOR-WRITTEN CONSULTATION NOTES AND EXPERIMENTED WITH 3 COMMON WORD EMBEDDING METHODS TO EXPLORE THE PRIVACY-PRESERVING PROPERTIES OF EACH. RESULTS: WE FOUND THAT IF PUBLICLY RELEASED EMBEDDINGS ARE TRAINED FROM A CORPUS ANONYMIZED BY PHI REMOVAL, IT IS POSSIBLE TO RECONSTRUCT UP TO 68.5% (N=411/600) OF THE FULL NAMES THAT REMAIN IN THE DEIDENTIFIED CORPUS AND ASSOCIATED SENSITIVE INFORMATION TO SPECIFIC PATIENTS IN THE CORPUS FROM WHICH THE EMBEDDINGS WERE CREATED. WE ALSO FOUND THAT THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE WORD VECTOR REPRESENTATION OF A PATIENT'S NAME AND A DIAGNOSTIC BILLING CODE IS INFORMATIVE AND DIFFERS SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE NAME AND A CODE NOT BILLED FOR THAT PATIENT. CONCLUSIONS: SPECIAL CARE MUST BE TAKEN WHEN SHARING WORD EMBEDDINGS CREATED FROM CLINICAL TEXTS, AS CURRENT APPROACHES MAY COMPROMISE PATIENT PRIVACY. IF PHI REMOVAL IS USED FOR ANONYMIZATION BEFORE TRADITIONAL WORD EMBEDDINGS ARE TRAINED, IT IS POSSIBLE TO ATTRIBUTE SENSITIVE INFORMATION TO PATIENTS WHO HAVE NOT BEEN FULLY DEIDENTIFIED BY THE (NECESSARILY IMPERFECT) REMOVAL ALGORITHMS. A PROMISING ALTERNATIVE (IE, ANONYMIZATION BY PHI REPLACEMENT) MAY AVOID THESE FLAWS. OUR RESULTS ARE TIMELY AND CRITICAL, AS AN INCREASING NUMBER OF RESEARCHERS ARE PUSHING FOR PUBLICLY AVAILABLE HEALTH DATA.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
EXPLORING WHAT IS ENCODED IN DISTRIBUTIONAL WORD VECTORS: A NEUROBIOLOGICALLY MOTIVATED ANALYSIS. THE PERVASIVE USE OF DISTRIBUTIONAL SEMANTIC MODELS OR WORD EMBEDDINGS FOR BOTH COGNITIVE MODELING AND PRACTICAL APPLICATION IS BECAUSE OF THEIR REMARKABLE ABILITY TO REPRESENT THE MEANINGS OF WORDS. HOWEVER, RELATIVELY LITTLE EFFORT HAS BEEN MADE TO EXPLORE WHAT TYPES OF INFORMATION ARE ENCODED IN DISTRIBUTIONAL WORD VECTORS. KNOWING THE INTERNAL KNOWLEDGE EMBEDDED IN WORD VECTORS IS IMPORTANT FOR COGNITIVE MODELING USING DISTRIBUTIONAL SEMANTIC MODELS. THEREFORE, IN THIS PAPER, WE ATTEMPT TO IDENTIFY THE KNOWLEDGE ENCODED IN WORD VECTORS BY CONDUCTING A COMPUTATIONAL EXPERIMENT USING BINDER ET AL.'S (2016) FEATURAL CONCEPTUAL REPRESENTATIONS BASED ON NEUROBIOLOGICALLY MOTIVATED ATTRIBUTES. IN AN EXPERIMENT, THESE CONCEPTUAL VECTORS ARE PREDICTED FROM TEXT-BASED WORD VECTORS USING A NEURAL NETWORK AND LINEAR TRANSFORMATION, AND PREDICTION PERFORMANCE IS COMPARED AMONG VARIOUS TYPES OF INFORMATION. THE ANALYSIS DEMONSTRATES THAT ABSTRACT INFORMATION IS GENERALLY PREDICTED MORE ACCURATELY BY WORD VECTORS THAN PERCEPTUAL AND SPATIOTEMPORAL INFORMATION, AND SPECIFICALLY, THE PREDICTION ACCURACY OF COGNITIVE AND SOCIAL INFORMATION IS HIGHER. EMOTIONAL INFORMATION IS ALSO FOUND TO BE SUCCESSFULLY PREDICTED FOR ABSTRACT WORDS. THESE RESULTS INDICATE THAT LANGUAGE CAN BE A MAJOR SOURCE OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT ABSTRACT ATTRIBUTES, AND THEY SUPPORT THE RECENT VIEW THAT EMPHASIZES THE IMPORTANCE OF LANGUAGE FOR ABSTRACT CONCEPTS. FURTHERMORE, WE SHOW THAT WORD VECTORS CAN CAPTURE SOME TYPES OF PERCEPTUAL AND SPATIOTEMPORAL INFORMATION ABOUT CONCRETE CONCEPTS AND SOME RELEVANT WORD CATEGORIES. THIS SUGGESTS THAT LANGUAGE STATISTICS CAN ENCODE MORE PERCEPTUAL KNOWLEDGE THAN OFTEN EXPECTED.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
EXTERNAL VALIDATION OF AN OPIOID MISUSE MACHINE LEARNING CLASSIFIER IN HOSPITALIZED ADULT PATIENTS. BACKGROUND: OPIOID MISUSE SCREENING IN HOSPITALS IS RESOURCE-INTENSIVE AND RARELY DONE. MANY HOSPITALIZED PATIENTS ARE NEVER OFFERED OPIOID TREATMENT. AN AUTOMATED APPROACH LEVERAGING ROUTINELY CAPTURED ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD (EHR) DATA MAY BE EASIER FOR HOSPITALS TO INSTITUTE. WE PREVIOUSLY DERIVED AND INTERNALLY VALIDATED AN OPIOID CLASSIFIER IN A SEPARATE HOSPITAL SETTING. THE AIM IS TO EXTERNALLY VALIDATE OUR PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED AND OPEN-SOURCE MACHINE-LEARNING CLASSIFIER AT A DIFFERENT HOSPITAL FOR IDENTIFYING CASES OF OPIOID MISUSE. METHODS: AN OBSERVATIONAL COHORT OF 56,227 ADULT HOSPITALIZATIONS WAS EXAMINED BETWEEN OCTOBER 2017 AND DECEMBER 2019 DURING A HOSPITAL-WIDE SUBSTANCE USE SCREENING PROGRAM WITH MANUAL SCREENING. MANUALLY COMPLETED DRUG ABUSE SCREENING TEST SERVED AS THE REFERENCE STANDARD TO VALIDATE A CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (CNN) CLASSIFIER WITH CODED WORD EMBEDDING FEATURES FROM THE CLINICAL NOTES OF THE EHR. THE OPIOID CLASSIFIER UTILIZED ALL NOTES IN THE EHR AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS WAS ALSO PERFORMED ON THE FIRST 24 H OF NOTES. CALIBRATION WAS PERFORMED TO ACCOUNT FOR THE LOWER PREVALENCE THAN IN THE ORIGINAL COHORT. RESULTS: MANUAL SCREENING FOR SUBSTANCE MISUSE WAS COMPLETED IN 67.8% (N = 56,227) WITH 1.1% (N = 628) IDENTIFIED WITH OPIOID MISUSE. THE DATA FOR EXTERNAL VALIDATION INCLUDED 2,482,900 NOTES WITH 67,969 UNIQUE CLINICAL CONCEPT FEATURES. THE OPIOID CLASSIFIER HAD AN AUC OF 0.99 (95% CI 0.99-0.99) ACROSS THE ENCOUNTER AND 0.98 (95% CI 0.98-0.99) USING ONLY THE FIRST 24 H OF NOTES. IN THE CALIBRATED CLASSIFIER, THE SENSITIVITY AND POSITIVE PREDICTIVE VALUE WERE 0.81 (95% CI 0.77-0.84) AND 0.72 (95% CI 0.68-0.75). FOR THE FIRST 24 H, THEY WERE 0.75 (95% CI 0.71-0.78) AND 0.61 (95% CI 0.57-0.64). CONCLUSIONS: OUR OPIOID MISUSE CLASSIFIER HAD GOOD DISCRIMINATION DURING EXTERNAL VALIDATION. OUR MODEL MAY PROVIDE A COMPREHENSIVE AND AUTOMATED APPROACH TO OPIOID MISUSE IDENTIFICATION THAT AUGMENTS CURRENT WORKFLOWS AND OVERCOMES MANUAL SCREENING BARRIERS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
EXTRACTING ALCOHOL AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE STATUS FROM CLINICAL NOTES: THE ADDED VALUE OF NURSING DATA. WE APPLIED AN OPEN SOURCE NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) SYSTEM "NIMBLEMINER" TO IDENTIFY CLINICAL NOTES WITH MENTIONS OF ALCOHOL AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE. NIMBLEMINER ALLOWS USERS TO RAPIDLY DISCOVER CLINICAL VOCABULARIES (USING WORD EMBEDDING MODEL) AND THEN IMPLEMENT MACHINE LEARNING FOR TEXT CLASSIFICATION. WE USED A LARGE INPATIENT DATASET WITH OVER 50,000 INTENSIVE CARE UNIT ADMISSIONS (MIMIC II). CLINICAL NOTES INCLUDED PHYSICIAN-WRITTEN DISCHARGE SUMMARIES (N = 51,201) AND NURSING NOTES (N = 412,343). WE FIRST USED PHYSICIAN-WRITTEN DISCHARGE SUMMARIES TO TRAIN THE SYSTEM'S ALGORITHM AND THEN ADDED NURSING NOTES TO THE PHYSICIAN-WRITTEN DISCHARGE SUMMARIES AND EVALUATED ALGORITHMS PREDICTION ACCURACY. ADDING NURSING NOTES TO THE PHYSICIAN-WRITTEN DISCHARGE SUMMARIES RESULTED IN ALMOST TWO-FOLD VOCABULARY EXPANSION. NIMBLEMINER SLIGHTLY OUTPERFORMED OTHER STATE-OF-THE-ART NLP SYSTEMS (AVERAGE F-SCORE = .84), WHILE REQUIRING SIGNIFICANTLY LESS TIME FOR THE ALGORITHMS DEVELOPMENT.: OUR FINDINGS UNDERLINE THE IMPORTANCE OF NURSING DATA FOR THE ANALYSIS OF ELECTRONIC PATIENT RECORDS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
EXTRACTING DRUG NAMES AND ASSOCIATED ATTRIBUTES FROM DISCHARGE SUMMARIES: TEXT MINING STUDY. BACKGROUND: DRUG PRESCRIPTIONS ARE OFTEN RECORDED IN FREE-TEXT CLINICAL NARRATIVES; MAKING THIS INFORMATION AVAILABLE IN A STRUCTURED FORM IS IMPORTANT TO SUPPORT MANY HEALTH-RELATED TASKS. ALTHOUGH SEVERAL NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) METHODS HAVE BEEN PROPOSED TO EXTRACT SUCH INFORMATION, MANY CHALLENGES REMAIN. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY EVALUATES THE FEASIBILITY OF USING NLP AND DEEP LEARNING APPROACHES FOR EXTRACTING AND LINKING DRUG NAMES AND ASSOCIATED ATTRIBUTES IDENTIFIED IN CLINICAL FREE-TEXT NOTES AND PRESENTS AN EXTENSIVE ERROR ANALYSIS OF DIFFERENT METHODS. THIS STUDY INITIATED WITH THE PARTICIPATION IN THE 2018 NATIONAL NLP CLINICAL CHALLENGES (N2C2) SHARED TASK ON ADVERSE DRUG EVENTS AND MEDICATION EXTRACTION. METHODS: THE PROPOSED SYSTEM (DRUGEX) CONSISTS OF A NAMED ENTITY RECOGNIZER (NER) TO IDENTIFY DRUGS AND ASSOCIATED ATTRIBUTES AND A RELATION EXTRACTION (RE) METHOD TO IDENTIFY THE RELATIONS BETWEEN THEM. FOR NER, WE EXPLORED DEEP LEARNING-BASED APPROACHES (IE, BIDIRECTIONAL LONG-SHORT TERM MEMORY WITH CONDITIONAL RANDOM FIELDS [BILSTM-CRFS]) WITH VARIOUS EMBEDDINGS (IE, WORD EMBEDDING, CHARACTER EMBEDDING [CE], AND SEMANTIC-FEATURE EMBEDDING) TO INVESTIGATE HOW DIFFERENT EMBEDDINGS INFLUENCE THE PERFORMANCE. A RULE-BASED METHOD WAS IMPLEMENTED FOR RE AND COMPARED WITH A CONTEXT-AWARE LONG-SHORT TERM MEMORY (LSTM) MODEL. THE METHODS WERE TRAINED AND EVALUATED USING THE 2018 N2C2 SHARED TASK DATA. RESULTS: THE EXPERIMENTS SHOWED THAT THE BEST MODEL (BILSTM-CRFS WITH PRETRAINED WORD EMBEDDINGS [PWE] AND CE) ACHIEVED LENIENT MICRO F-SCORES OF 0.921 FOR NER, 0.927 FOR RE, AND 0.855 FOR THE END-TO-END SYSTEM. NER, WHICH RELIES ON THE PRETRAINED WORD AND SEMANTIC EMBEDDINGS, PERFORMED BETTER ON MOST INDIVIDUAL ENTITY TYPES, BUT NER WITH PWE AND CE HAD THE HIGHEST CLASSIFICATION EFFICIENCY AMONG THE PROPOSED APPROACHES. EXTRACTING RELATIONS USING THE RULE-BASED METHOD ACHIEVED HIGHER ACCURACY THAN THE CONTEXT-AWARE LSTM FOR MOST RELATIONS. INTERESTINGLY, THE LSTM MODEL PERFORMED NOTABLY BETTER IN THE REASON-DRUG RELATIONS, THE MOST CHALLENGING RELATION TYPE. CONCLUSIONS: THE PROPOSED END-TO-END SYSTEM ACHIEVED ENCOURAGING RESULTS AND DEMONSTRATED THE FEASIBILITY OF USING DEEP LEARNING METHODS TO EXTRACT MEDICATION INFORMATION FROM FREE-TEXT DATA.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
EXTRACTING SMOKING STATUS FROM ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS USING NLP AND DEEP LEARNING. HALF A MILLION PEOPLE DIE EVERY YEAR FROM SMOKING-RELATED ISSUES ACROSS THE UNITED STATES. IT IS ESSENTIAL TO IDENTIFY INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE TOBACCO-DEPENDENT IN ORDER TO IMPLEMENT PREVENTIVE MEASURES. IN THIS STUDY, WE INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF DEEP LEARNING MODELS TO EXTRACT SMOKING STATUS OF PATIENTS FROM CLINICAL PROGRESS NOTES. A NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) PIPELINE WAS BUILT THAT CLEANS THE PROGRESS NOTES PRIOR TO PROCESSING BY THREE DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS: A CNN, A UNIDIRECTIONAL LSTM, AND A BIDIRECTIONAL LSTM. EACH OF THESE MODELS WAS TRAINED WITH A PRE- TRAINED OR A POST-TRAINED WORD EMBEDDING LAYER. THREE TRADITIONAL MACHINE LEARNING MODELS WERE ALSO EMPLOYED TO COMPARE AGAINST THE NEURAL NETWORKS. EACH MODEL HAS GENERATED BOTH BINARY AND MULTI-CLASS LABEL CLASSIFICATION. OUR RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE CNN MODEL WITH A PRE-TRAINED EMBEDDING LAYER PERFORMED THE BEST FOR BOTH BINARY AND MULTI- CLASS LABEL CLASSIFICATION.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
EXTRACTION OF DRUG-DRUG INTERACTION USING NEURAL EMBEDDING. INFORMATION ON CHANGES IN A DRUG'S EFFECT WHEN TAKEN IN COMBINATION WITH A SECOND DRUG, KNOWN AS DRUG-DRUG INTERACTION (DDI), IS RELEVANT IN THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY. DDIS CAN DELAY, DECREASE, OR ENHANCE ABSORPTION OF EITHER DRUG AND THUS DECREASE OR INCREASE THEIR ACTION OR CAUSE ADVERSE EFFECTS. INFORMATION EXTRACTION (IE) CAN BE OF GREAT BENEFIT IN ALLOWING IDENTIFICATION AND EXTRACTION OF RELEVANT INFORMATION ON DDIS. WE HERE PROPOSE AN APPROACH FOR THE EXTRACTION OF DDI FROM TEXT USING NEURAL WORD EMBEDDING TO TRAIN A MACHINE LEARNING SYSTEM. RESULTS SHOW THAT OUR SYSTEM IS COMPETITIVE AGAINST OTHER SYSTEMS FOR THE TASK OF EXTRACTING DDIS, AND THAT SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS CAN BE ACHIEVED BY LEARNING FROM WORD FEATURES AND USING A DEEP-LEARNING APPROACH. OUR STUDY DEMONSTRATES THAT MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES SUCH AS NEURAL NETWORKS AND DEEP LEARNING METHODS CAN EFFICIENTLY AID IN IE FROM TEXT. OUR PROPOSED APPROACH IS WELL SUITED TO PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN FUTURE RESEARCH.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
EXTRACTION OF MEDICATION-EFFECT RELATIONS IN TWITTER DATA WITH NEURAL EMBEDDING AND RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORK. RECENTLY, AN ACTIVE AREA OF RESEARCH IN PHARMACOVIGILANCE IS TO USE SOCIAL MEDIA SUCH AS TWITTER AS AN ALTERNATIVE DATA SOURCE TO GATHER PATIENT-GENERATED INFORMATION PERTAINING TO MEDICATION USE. MOST OF THR PUBLISHED WORK FOCUSES ON IDENTIFYING MENTIONS OF ADVERSE EFFECTS IN SOCIAL MEDIA DATA BUT RARELY INVESTIGATING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A MENTIONED MEDICATION AND ANY MENTIONED EFFECT EXPRESSIONS. IN THIS STUDY, WE TREATED THIS RELATION EXTRACTION TASK AS A CLASSIFICATION PROBLEM, AND REPRESENTED THE TWITTER TEXT WITH NEURAL EMBEDDING WHICH WAS FED TO A RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORK CLASSIFIER. THE CLASSIFICATION PERFORMANCE OF OUR METHOD WAS INVESTIGATED IN COMPARISON WITH 4 BASELINE WORD EMBEDDING METHODS ON A CORPUS OF 9516 ANNOTATED TWEETS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
FAD-BERT: IMPROVED PREDICTION OF FAD BINDING SITES USING PRE-TRAINING OF DEEP BIDIRECTIONAL TRANSFORMERS. THE ELECTRON TRANSPORT CHAIN IS A SERIES OF PROTEIN COMPLEXES EMBEDDED IN THE PROCESS OF CELLULAR RESPIRATION, WHICH IS AN IMPORTANT PROCESS TO TRANSFER ELECTRONS AND OTHER MACROMOLECULES THROUGHOUT THE CELL. IDENTIFYING FLAVIN ADENINE DINUCLEOTIDE (FAD) BINDING SITES IN THE ELECTRON TRANSPORT CHAIN IS VITAL SINCE IT HELPS BIOLOGICAL RESEARCHERS PRECISELY UNDERSTAND HOW ELECTRONS ARE PRODUCED AND ARE TRANSPORTED IN CELLS. THIS STUDY DISTILLS AND ANALYZES THE CONTEXTUALIZED WORD EMBEDDING FROM PRE-TRAINED BERT MODELS TO EXPLORE SIMILARITIES IN NATURAL LANGUAGE AND PROTEIN SEQUENCES. THEREBY, WE PROPOSE A NEW APPROACH BASED ON PRE-TRAINING OF BIDIRECTIONAL ENCODER REPRESENTATIONS FROM TRANSFORMERS (BERT), POSITION-SPECIFIC SCORING MATRIX PROFILES (PSSM), AMINO ACID INDEX DATABASE (AAINDEX) TO PREDICT FAD-BINDING SITES FROM THE TRANSPORT PROTEINS WHICH ARE FOUND IN NATURE RECENTLY. OUR PROPOSED APPROACH ARCHIVES 85.14% ACCURACY AND IMPROVES ACCURACY BY 11%, WITH MATTHEW'S CORRELATION COEFFICIENT OF 0.39 COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUS METHOD ON THE SAME INDEPENDENT SET. WE ALSO DEPLOY A WEB SERVER THAT IDENTIFIES FAD-BINDING SITES IN ELECTRON TRANSPORTERS AVAILABLE FOR ACADEMICS AT HTTP://140.138.155.216/FADBERT/.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
FEATURE EXTRACTION FOR PHENOTYPING FROM SEMANTIC AND KNOWLEDGE RESOURCES. OBJECTIVE: PHENOTYPING ALGORITHMS CAN EFFICIENTLY AND ACCURATELY IDENTIFY PATIENTS WITH A SPECIFIC DISEASE PHENOTYPE AND CONSTRUCT ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS (EHR)-BASED COHORTS FOR SUBSEQUENT CLINICAL OR GENOMIC STUDIES. PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE INTRODUCED UNSUPERVISED EHR-BASED FEATURE SELECTION METHODS THAT YIELDED ALGORITHMS WITH HIGH ACCURACY. HOWEVER, THOSE SELECTION METHODS STILL REQUIRE EXPERT INTERVENTION TO TWEAK THE PARAMETER SETTINGS ACCORDING TO THE EHR DATA DISTRIBUTION FOR EACH PHENOTYPE. TO FURTHER ACCELERATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF PHENOTYPING ALGORITHMS, WE PROPOSE A FULLY AUTOMATED AND ROBUST UNSUPERVISED FEATURE SELECTION METHOD THAT LEVERAGES ONLY PUBLICLY AVAILABLE MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE SOURCES, INSTEAD OF EHR DATA. METHODS: SEMANTICS-DRIVEN FEATURE EXTRACTION (SEDFE) COLLECTS MEDICAL CONCEPTS FROM ONLINE KNOWLEDGE SOURCES AS CANDIDATE FEATURES AND GIVES THEM VECTOR-FORM DISTRIBUTIONAL SEMANTIC REPRESENTATIONS DERIVED WITH NEURAL WORD EMBEDDING AND THE UNIFIED MEDICAL LANGUAGE SYSTEM METATHESAURUS. A NUMBER OF FEATURES THAT ARE SEMANTICALLY CLOSEST AND THAT SUFFICIENTLY CHARACTERIZE THE TARGET PHENOTYPE ARE DETERMINED BY A LINEAR DECOMPOSITION CRITERION AND ARE SELECTED FOR THE FINAL CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHM. RESULTS: SEDFE WAS COMPARED WITH THE EHR-BASED SAFE ALGORITHM AND DOMAIN EXPERTS ON FEATURE SELECTION FOR THE CLASSIFICATION OF FIVE PHENOTYPES INCLUDING CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE, RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS, CROHN'S DISEASE, ULCERATIVE COLITIS, AND PEDIATRIC PULMONARY ARTERIAL HYPERTENSION USING BOTH SUPERVISED AND UNSUPERVISED APPROACHES. ALGORITHMS YIELDED BY SEDFE ACHIEVED COMPARABLE ACCURACY TO THOSE YIELDED BY SAFE AND EXPERT-CURATED FEATURES. SEDFE IS ALSO ROBUST TO THE INPUT SEMANTIC VECTORS. CONCLUSION: SEDFE ATTAINS SATISFYING PERFORMANCE IN UNSUPERVISED FEATURE SELECTION FOR EHR PHENOTYPING. BOTH FULLY AUTOMATED AND EHR-INDEPENDENT, THIS METHOD PROMISES EFFICIENCY AND ACCURACY IN DEVELOPING ALGORITHMS FOR HIGH-THROUGHPUT PHENOTYPING.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
FEATURE SPACE TRANSFORMATION FOR FAULT DIAGNOSIS OF ROTATING MACHINERY UNDER DIFFERENT WORKING CONDITIONS. IN RECENT YEARS, VARIOUS DEEP LEARNING MODELS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED FOR THE FAULT DIAGNOSIS OF ROTATING MACHINES. HOWEVER, IN PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS RELATED TO FAULT DIAGNOSIS, IT IS DIFFICULT TO IMMEDIATELY IMPLEMENT A TRAINED MODEL BECAUSE THE DISTRIBUTION OF SOURCE DATA AND TARGET DOMAIN DATA HAVE DIFFERENT DISTRIBUTIONS. ADDITIONALLY, COLLECTING FAILURE DATA FOR VARIOUS OPERATING CONDITIONS IS TIME CONSUMING AND EXPENSIVE. IN THIS PAPER, WE INTRODUCE A NEW TRANSFORMATION METHOD FOR THE LATENT SPACE BETWEEN DOMAINS USING THE SOURCE DOMAIN AND NORMAL DATA OF THE TARGET DOMAIN THAT CAN BE EASILY COLLECTED. INSPIRED BY SEMANTIC TRANSFORMATIONS IN AN EMBEDDED SPACE IN THE FIELD OF WORD EMBEDDING, DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE SOURCE AND TARGET DOMAINS ARE MINIMIZED BY TRANSFORMING THE LATENT REPRESENTATION SPACE IN WHICH FAULT ATTRIBUTES ARE PRESERVED. TO MATCH THE FEATURE AREA AND DISTRIBUTION, SPATIAL ATTENTION IS APPLIED TO LEARN THE LATENT FEATURE SPACES, AND THE 1D CNN LSTM ARCHITECTURE IS IMPLEMENTED TO MAXIMIZE THE INTRA-CLASS CLASSIFICATION. THE PROPOSED MODEL WAS VALIDATED FOR TWO TYPES OF ROTATING MACHINES SUCH AS A DATASET OF ROLLING BEARINGS AS CWRU AND A GEARBOX DATASET OF HEAVY MACHINERY. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS SHOW THE PROPOSED METHOD HAS HIGHER CROSS-DOMAIN DIAGNOSTIC ACCURACY THAN OTHERS, THEREFORE SHOWING RELIABLE GENERALIZATION PERFORMANCE IN ROTATING MACHINES OPERATING UNDER VARIOUS CONDITIONS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
FEATURE-BASED LEARNING IN DRUG PRESCRIPTION SYSTEM FOR MEDICAL CLINICS. RAPID INCREASES IN DATA VOLUME AND VARIETY POSE A CHALLENGE TO SAFE DRUG PRESCRIPTION FOR HEALTH PROFESSIONALS LIKE DOCTORS AND DENTISTS. THIS IS ADDRESSED BY OUR STUDY, WHICH PRESENTS INNOVATIVE APPROACHES IN MINING DATA FROM DRUG CORPUS AND EXTRACTING FEATURE VECTORS TO COMBINE THIS KNOWLEDGE WITH INDIVIDUAL PATIENT MEDICAL PROFILES. WITHIN OUR THREE-TIERED FRAMEWORK-THE PREDICTION LAYER, THE KNOWLEDGE LAYER AND THE PRESENTATION LAYER-WE DESCRIBE MULTIPLE APPROACHES IN COMPUTING SIMILARITY RATIOS FROM THE FEATURE VECTORS, ILLUSTRATED WITH AN EXAMPLE OF APPLYING THE FRAMEWORK IN A TYPICAL MEDICAL CLINIC. EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION SHOWS THAT THE WORD EMBEDDING MODEL PERFORMS BETTER THAN THE ADVERSE NETWORK MODEL, WITH A F SCORE OF 0.75. THE F SCORE IS A COMMON METRICS USED FOR EVALUATING THE PERFORMANCE OF CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHMS. SIMILARITY TO A DRUG THE PATIENT IS ALLERGIC TO OR IS TAKING ARE IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE SUITABILITY OF A DRUG FOR PRESCRIPTION. HENCE, SUCH AN APPROACH, WHEN INTEGRATED WITHIN THE CLINICAL WORK-FLOW, WILL REDUCE PRESCRIPTION ERRORS THEREBY INCREASING PATIENT HEALTH OUTCOMES.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
FINDICI: USING MACHINE LEARNING TO DETECT LINGUISTIC INCONSISTENCIES BETWEEN CODE AND NATURAL LANGUAGE DESCRIPTIONS IN INFRASTRUCTURE-AS-CODE. LINGUISTIC ANTI-PATTERNS ARE RECURRING POOR PRACTICES CONCERNING INCONSISTENCIES IN THE NAMING, DOCUMENTATION, AND IMPLEMENTATION OF AN ENTITY. THEY IMPEDE THE READABILITY, UNDERSTANDABILITY, AND MAINTAINABILITY OF SOURCE CODE. THIS PAPER ATTEMPTS TO DETECT LINGUISTIC ANTI-PATTERNS IN INFRASTRUCTURE-AS-CODE (IAC) SCRIPTS USED TO PROVISION AND MANAGE COMPUTING ENVIRONMENTS. IN PARTICULAR, WE CONSIDER INCONSISTENCIES BETWEEN THE LOGIC/BODY OF IAC CODE UNITS AND THEIR SHORT TEXT NAMES. TO THIS END, WE PROPOSE FINDICI A NOVEL AUTOMATED APPROACH THAT EMPLOYS WORD EMBEDDING AND CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHMS. WE BUILD AND USE THE ABSTRACT SYNTAX TREE OF IAC CODE UNITS TO CREATE CODE EMBEDDINGS USED BY MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES TO DETECT INCONSISTENT IAC CODE UNITS. WE EVALUATED OUR APPROACH WITH TWO EXPERIMENTS ON ANSIBLE TASKS SYSTEMATICALLY EXTRACTED FROM OPEN SOURCE REPOSITORIES FOR VARIOUS WORD EMBEDDING MODELS AND CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHMS. CLASSICAL MACHINE LEARNING MODELS AND NOVEL DEEP LEARNING MODELS WITH DIFFERENT WORD EMBEDDING METHODS SHOWED COMPARABLE AND SATISFACTORY RESULTS IN DETECTING INCONSISTENT ANSIBLE TASKS RELATED TO THE TOP-10 USED ANSIBLE MODULES.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
FINE-TUNING WORD EMBEDDINGS FOR HIERARCHICAL REPRESENTATION OF DATA USING A CORPUS AND A KNOWLEDGE BASE FOR VARIOUS MACHINE LEARNING APPLICATIONS. WORD EMBEDDING MODELS HAVE RECENTLY SHOWN SOME CAPABILITY TO ENCODE HIERARCHICAL INFORMATION THAT EXISTS IN TEXTUAL DATA. HOWEVER, SUCH MODELS DO NOT EXPLICITLY ENCODE THE HIERARCHICAL STRUCTURE THAT EXISTS AMONG WORDS. IN THIS WORK, WE PROPOSE A METHOD TO LEARN HIERARCHICAL WORD EMBEDDINGS (HWES) IN A SPECIFIC ORDER TO ENCODE THE HIERARCHICAL INFORMATION OF A KNOWLEDGE BASE (KB) IN A VECTOR SPACE. TO LEARN THE WORD EMBEDDINGS, OUR PROPOSED METHOD CONSIDERS NOT ONLY THE HYPERNYM RELATIONS THAT EXIST BETWEEN WORDS IN A KB BUT ALSO CONTEXTUAL INFORMATION IN A TEXT CORPUS. THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS ON VARIOUS APPLICATIONS, SUCH AS SUPERVISED AND UNSUPERVISED HYPERNYMY DETECTION, GRADED LEXICAL ENTAILMENT PREDICTION, HIERARCHICAL PATH PREDICTION, AND WORD RECONSTRUCTION TASKS, SHOW THE ABILITY OF THE PROPOSED METHOD TO ENCODE THE HIERARCHY. MOREOVER, THE PROPOSED METHOD OUTPERFORMS PREVIOUSLY PROPOSED METHODS FOR LEARNING NONSPECIALISED, HYPERNYM-SPECIFIC, AND HIERARCHICAL WORD EMBEDDINGS ON MULTIPLE BENCHMARKS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
FOODKG: A TOOL TO ENRICH KNOWLEDGE GRAPHS USING MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES. WHILE THERE EXIST A PLETHORA OF DATASETS ON THE INTERNET RELATED TO FOOD, ENERGY, AND WATER (FEW), THERE IS A REAL LACK OF RELIABLE METHODS AND TOOLS THAT CAN CONSUME THESE RESOURCES. THIS HINDERS THE DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL DECISION-MAKING APPLICATIONS UTILIZING KNOWLEDGE GRAPHS. IN THIS PAPER, WE INTRODUCE A NOVEL SOFTWARE TOOL, CALLED FOODKG, THAT ENRICHES FEW KNOWLEDGE GRAPHS USING ADVANCED MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES. OUR OVERARCHING GOAL IS TO IMPROVE DECISION-MAKING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY AS WELL AS TO PROVIDE IMPROVED SEARCH RESULTS FOR DATA SCIENTISTS IN THE FEW DOMAINS. GIVEN AN INPUT KNOWLEDGE GRAPH (CONSTRUCTED ON RAW FEW DATASETS), FOODKG ENRICHES IT WITH SEMANTICALLY RELATED TRIPLES, RELATIONS, AND IMAGES BASED ON THE ORIGINAL DATASET TERMS AND CLASSES. FOODKG EMPLOYS AN EXISTING GRAPH EMBEDDING TECHNIQUE TRAINED ON A CONTROLLED VOCABULARY CALLED AGROVOC, WHICH IS PUBLISHED BY THE FOOD AND AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION OF THE UNITED NATIONS. AGROVOC INCLUDES TERMS AND CLASSES IN THE AGRICULTURE AND FOOD DOMAINS. AS A RESULT, FOODKG CAN ENHANCE KNOWLEDGE GRAPHS WITH SEMANTIC SIMILARITY SCORES AND RELATIONS BETWEEN DIFFERENT CLASSES, CLASSIFY THE EXISTING ENTITIES, AND ALLOW FEW EXPERTS AND RESEARCHERS TO USE SCIENTIFIC TERMS FOR DESCRIBING FEW CONCEPTS. THE RESULTING MODEL OBTAINED AFTER TRAINING ON AGROVOC WAS EVALUATED AGAINST THE STATE-OF-THE-ART WORD EMBEDDING AND KNOWLEDGE GRAPH EMBEDDING MODELS THAT WERE TRAINED ON THE SAME DATASET. WE OBSERVED THAT THIS MODEL OUTPERFORMED ITS COMPETITORS BASED ON THE SPEARMAN CORRELATION COEFFICIENT SCORE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
FRACTURE MECHANICS METHOD FOR WORD EMBEDDING GENERATION OF NEURAL PROBABILISTIC LINGUISTIC MODEL. WORD EMBEDDING, A LEXICAL VECTOR REPRESENTATION GENERATED VIA THE NEURAL LINGUISTIC MODEL (NLM), IS EMPIRICALLY DEMONSTRATED TO BE APPROPRIATE FOR IMPROVEMENT OF THE PERFORMANCE OF TRADITIONAL LANGUAGE MODEL. HOWEVER, THE SUPREME DIMENSIONALITY THAT IS INHERENT IN NLM CONTRIBUTES TO THE PROBLEMS OF HYPERPARAMETERS AND LONG-TIME TRAINING IN MODELING. HERE, WE PROPOSE A FORCE-DIRECTED METHOD TO IMPROVE SUCH PROBLEMS FOR SIMPLIFYING THE GENERATION OF WORD EMBEDDING. IN THIS FRAMEWORK, EACH WORD IS ASSUMED AS A POINT IN THE REAL WORLD; THUS IT CAN APPROXIMATELY SIMULATE THE PHYSICAL MOVEMENT FOLLOWING CERTAIN MECHANICS. TO SIMULATE THE VARIATION OF MEANING IN PHRASES, WE USE THE FRACTURE MECHANICS TO DO THE FORMATION AND BREAKDOWN OF MEANING COMBINED BY A 2-GRAM WORD GROUP. WITH THE EXPERIMENTS ON THE NATURAL LINGUISTIC TASKS OF PART-OF-SPEECH TAGGING, NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION AND SEMANTIC ROLE LABELING, THE RESULT DEMONSTRATED THAT THE 2-DIMENSIONAL WORD EMBEDDING CAN RIVAL THE WORD EMBEDDINGS GENERATED BY CLASSIC NLMS, IN TERMS OF ACCURACY, RECALL, AND TEXT VISUALIZATION.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
FRAMEAXIS: CHARACTERIZING MICROFRAME BIAS AND INTENSITY WITH WORD EMBEDDING. FRAMING IS A PROCESS OF EMPHASIZING A CERTAIN ASPECT OF AN ISSUE OVER THE OTHERS, NUDGING READERS OR LISTENERS TOWARDS DIFFERENT POSITIONS ON THE ISSUE EVEN WITHOUT MAKING A BIASED ARGUMENT. HERE, WE PROPOSE FRAMEAXIS, A METHOD FOR CHARACTERIZING DOCUMENTS BY IDENTIFYING THE MOST RELEVANT SEMANTIC AXES ("MICROFRAMES") THAT ARE OVERREPRESENTED IN THE TEXT USING WORD EMBEDDING. OUR UNSUPERVISED APPROACH CAN BE READILY APPLIED TO LARGE DATASETS BECAUSE IT DOES NOT REQUIRE MANUAL ANNOTATIONS. IT CAN ALSO PROVIDE NUANCED INSIGHTS BY CONSIDERING A RICH SET OF SEMANTIC AXES. FRAMEAXIS IS DESIGNED TO QUANTITATIVELY TEASE OUT TWO IMPORTANT DIMENSIONS OF HOW MICROFRAMES ARE USED IN THE TEXT. MICROFRAME BIAS CAPTURES HOW BIASED THE TEXT IS ON A CERTAIN MICROFRAME, AND MICROFRAME INTENSITY SHOWS HOW PROMINENTLY A CERTAIN MICROFRAME IS USED. TOGETHER, THEY OFFER A DETAILED CHARACTERIZATION OF THE TEXT. WE DEMONSTRATE THAT MICROFRAMES WITH THE HIGHEST BIAS AND INTENSITY ALIGN WELL WITH SENTIMENT, TOPIC, AND PARTISAN SPECTRUM BY APPLYING FRAMEAXIS TO MULTIPLE DATASETS FROM RESTAURANT REVIEWS TO POLITICAL NEWS. THE EXISTING DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE CAN BE INCORPORATED INTO FRAMEAXIS BY USING CUSTOM MICROFRAMES AND BY USING FRAMEAXIS AS AN ITERATIVE EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS INSTRUMENT. ADDITIONALLY, WE PROPOSE METHODS FOR EXPLAINING THE RESULTS OF FRAMEAXIS AT THE LEVEL OF INDIVIDUAL WORDS AND DOCUMENTS. OUR METHOD MAY ACCELERATE SCALABLE AND SOPHISTICATED COMPUTATIONAL ANALYSES OF FRAMING ACROSS DISCIPLINES.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
FUZZY ONTOLOGY AND LSTM-BASED TEXT MINING: A TRANSPORTATION NETWORK MONITORING SYSTEM FOR ASSISTING TRAVEL. INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS (ITSS) UTILIZE A SENSOR NETWORK-BASED SYSTEM TO GATHER AND INTERPRET TRAFFIC INFORMATION. IN ADDITION, MOBILITY USERS UTILIZE MOBILE APPLICATIONS TO COLLECT TRANSPORT INFORMATION FOR SAFE TRAVELING. HOWEVER, THESE TYPES OF INFORMATION ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO EXAMINE ALL ASPECTS OF THE TRANSPORTATION NETWORKS. THEREFORE, BOTH ITSS AND MOBILITY USERS NEED A SMART APPROACH AND SOCIAL MEDIA DATA, WHICH CAN HELP ITSS EXAMINE TRANSPORT SERVICES, SUPPORT TRAFFIC AND CONTROL MANAGEMENT, AND HELP MOBILITY USERS TRAVEL SAFELY. PEOPLE UTILIZE SOCIAL NETWORKS TO SHARE THEIR THOUGHTS AND OPINIONS REGARDING TRANSPORTATION, WHICH ARE USEFUL FOR ITSS AND TRAVELERS. HOWEVER, USER-GENERATED TEXT ON SOCIAL MEDIA IS SHORT IN LENGTH, UNSTRUCTURED, AND COVERS A BROAD RANGE OF DYNAMIC TOPICS. THE APPLICATION OF RECENT MACHINE LEARNING (ML) APPROACH IS INEFFICIENT FOR EXTRACTING RELEVANT FEATURES FROM UNSTRUCTURED DATA, DETECTING WORD POLARITY OF FEATURES, AND CLASSIFYING THE SENTIMENT OF FEATURES CORRECTLY. IN ADDITION, ML CLASSIFIERS CONSISTENTLY MISS THE SEMANTIC FEATURE OF THE WORD MEANING. A NOVEL FUZZY ONTOLOGY-BASED SEMANTIC KNOWLEDGE WITH WORD2VEC MODEL IS PROPOSED TO IMPROVE THE TASK OF TRANSPORTATION FEATURES EXTRACTION AND TEXT CLASSIFICATION USING THE BI-DIRECTIONAL LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY (BI-LSTM) APPROACH. THE PROPOSED FUZZY ONTOLOGY DESCRIBES SEMANTIC KNOWLEDGE ABOUT ENTITIES AND FEATURES AND THEIR RELATION IN THE TRANSPORTATION DOMAIN. FUZZY ONTOLOGY AND SMART METHODOLOGY ARE DEVELOPED IN WEB ONTOLOGY LANGUAGE AND JAVA, RESPECTIVELY. BY UTILIZING WORD EMBEDDING WITH FUZZY ONTOLOGY AS A REPRESENTATION OF TEXT, BI-LSTM SHOWS SATISFACTORY IMPROVEMENT IN BOTH THE EXTRACTION OF FEATURES AND THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE UNSTRUCTURED TEXT OF SOCIAL MEDIA.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
G2BASY: A FRAMEWORK TO IMPROVE THE RNN LANGUAGE MODEL AND EASE OVERFITTING PROBLEM. RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORKS ARE EFFICIENT WAYS OF TRAINING LANGUAGE MODELS, AND VARIOUS RNN NETWORKS HAVE BEEN PROPOSED TO IMPROVE PERFORMANCE. HOWEVER, WITH THE INCREASE OF NETWORK SCALES, THE OVERFITTING PROBLEM BECOMES MORE URGENT. IN THIS PAPER, WE PROPOSE A FRAMEWORK-G2BASY-TO SPEED UP THE TRAINING PROCESS AND EASE THE OVERFITTING PROBLEM. INSTEAD OF USING PREDEFINED HYPERPARAMETERS, WE DEVISE A GRADIENT INCREASING AND DECREASING TECHNIQUE THAT CHANGES THE PARAMETERS TRAINING BATCH SIZE AND INPUT DROPOUT SIMULTANEOUSLY BY A USER-DEFINED STEP SIZE. TOGETHER WITH A PRETRAINED WORD EMBEDDING INITIALIZATION PROCEDURE AND THE INTRODUCTION OF DIFFERENT OPTIMIZERS AT DIFFERENT LEARNING RATES, OUR FRAMEWORK SPEEDS UP THE TRAINING PROCESS DRAMATICALLY AND IMPROVES PERFORMANCE COMPARED WITH A BENCHMARK MODEL OF THE SAME SCALE. FOR THE WORD EMBEDDING INITIALIZATION, WE PROPOSE THE CONCEPT OF "ARTIFICIAL FEATURES" TO DESCRIBE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE OBTAINED WORD EMBEDDINGS. WE EXPERIMENT ON TWO OF THE MOST OFTEN USED CORPORA-THE PENN TREEBANK AND WIKITEXT-2 DATASETS-AND BOTH OUTPERFORM THE BENCHMARK RESULTS AND SHOW POTENTIAL TOWARDS FURTHER IMPROVEMENT. FURTHERMORE, OUR FRAMEWORK SHOWS BETTER RESULTS WITH THE LARGER AND MORE COMPLICATED WIKITEXT-2 CORPUS THAN WITH THE PENN TREEBANK. COMPARED WITH OTHER STATE-OF-THE-ART RESULTS, WE ACHIEVE COMPARABLE RESULTS WITH NETWORK SCALES HUNDREDS OF TIMES SMALLER AND WITHIN FEWER TRAINING EPOCHS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
GENE2VEC: DISTRIBUTED REPRESENTATION OF GENES BASED ON CO-EXPRESSION. BACKGROUND: EXISTING FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION OF GENES ARE CATEGORICAL, DISCRETE, AND MOSTLY THROUGH MANUAL PROCESS. IN THIS WORK, WE EXPLORE THE IDEA OF GENE EMBEDDING, DISTRIBUTED REPRESENTATION OF GENES, IN THE SPIRIT OF WORD EMBEDDING. RESULTS: FROM A PURE DATA-DRIVEN FASHION, WE TRAINED A 200-DIMENSION VECTOR REPRESENTATION OF ALL HUMAN GENES, USING GENE CO-EXPRESSION PATTERNS IN 984 DATA SETS FROM THE GEO DATABASES. THESE VECTORS CAPTURE FUNCTIONAL RELATEDNESS OF GENES IN TERMS OF RECOVERING KNOWN PATHWAYS - THE AVERAGE INNER PRODUCT (SIMILARITY) OF GENES WITHIN A PATHWAY IS 1.52X GREATER THAN THAT OF RANDOM GENES. USING T-SNE, WE PRODUCED A GENE CO-EXPRESSION MAP THAT SHOWS LOCAL CONCENTRATIONS OF TISSUE SPECIFIC GENES. WE ALSO ILLUSTRATED THE USEFULNESS OF THE EMBEDDED GENE VECTORS, LADEN WITH RICH INFORMATION ON GENE CO-EXPRESSION PATTERNS, IN TASKS SUCH AS GENE-GENE INTERACTION PREDICTION. CONCLUSIONS: WE PROPOSED A MACHINE LEARNING METHOD THAT UTILIZES TRANSCRIPTOME-WIDE GENE CO-EXPRESSION TO GENERATE A DISTRIBUTED REPRESENTATION OF GENES. WE FURTHER DEMONSTRATED THE UTILITY OF OUR DISTRIBUTION BY PREDICTING GENE-GENE INTERACTION BASED SOLELY ON GENE NAMES. THE DISTRIBUTED REPRESENTATION OF GENES COULD BE USEFUL FOR MORE BIOINFORMATICS APPLICATIONS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
GENE2VEC: GENE SUBSEQUENCE EMBEDDING FOR PREDICTION OF MAMMALIAN N (6)-METHYLADENOSINE SITES FROM MRNA. N (6)-METHYLADENOSINE (M(6)A) REFERS TO METHYLATION MODIFICATION OF THE ADENOSINE NUCLEOTIDE ACID AT THE NITROGEN-6 POSITION. MANY CONVENTIONAL COMPUTATIONAL METHODS FOR IDENTIFYING N (6)-METHYLADENOSINE SITES ARE LIMITED BY THE SMALL AMOUNT OF DATA AVAILABLE. TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE THOUSANDS OF M(6)A SITES DETECTED BY HIGH-THROUGHPUT SEQUENCING, IT IS NOW POSSIBLE TO DISCOVER THE CHARACTERISTICS OF M(6)A SEQUENCES USING DEEP LEARNING TECHNIQUES. TO THE BEST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE, OUR WORK IS THE FIRST ATTEMPT TO USE WORD EMBEDDING AND DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS FOR M(6)A PREDICTION FROM MRNA SEQUENCES. USING FOUR DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS, WE DEVELOPED A MODEL INFERRED FROM A LARGER SEQUENCE SHIFTING WINDOW THAT CAN PREDICT M(6)A ACCURATELY AND ROBUSTLY. FOUR PREDICTION SCHEMES WERE BUILT WITH VARIOUS RNA SEQUENCE REPRESENTATIONS AND OPTIMIZED CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS. THE SOFT VOTING RESULTS FROM THE FOUR DEEP NETWORKS WERE SHOWN TO OUTPERFORM ALL OF THE STATE-OF-THE-ART METHODS. WE EVALUATED THESE PREDICTORS MENTIONED ABOVE ON A RIGOROUS INDEPENDENT TEST DATA SET AND PROVED THAT OUR PROPOSED METHOD OUTPERFORMS THE STATE-OF-THE-ART PREDICTORS. THE TRAINING, INDEPENDENT, AND CROSS-SPECIES TESTING DATA SETS ARE MUCH LARGER THAN IN PREVIOUS STUDIES, WHICH COULD HELP TO AVOID THE PROBLEM OF OVERFITTING. FURTHERMORE, AN ONLINE PREDICTION WEB SERVER IMPLEMENTING THE FOUR PROPOSED PREDICTORS HAS BEEN BUILT AND IS AVAILABLE AT HTTP://SERVER.MALAB.CN/GENE2VEC/.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
GEOMETRIC MODELS REVEAL BEHAVIOURAL AND NEURAL SIGNATURES OF TRANSFORMING EXPERIENCES INTO MEMORIES. HOW DO WE PRESERVE AND DISTORT OUR ONGOING EXPERIENCES WHEN ENCODING THEM INTO EPISODIC MEMORIES? THE MENTAL CONTEXTS IN WHICH WE INTERPRET EXPERIENCES ARE OFTEN PERSON-SPECIFIC, EVEN WHEN THE EXPERIENCES THEMSELVES ARE SHARED. HERE WE DEVELOP A GEOMETRIC FRAMEWORK FOR MATHEMATICALLY CHARACTERIZING THE SUBJECTIVE CONCEPTUAL CONTENT OF DYNAMIC NATURALISTIC EXPERIENCES. WE MODEL EXPERIENCES AND MEMORIES AS TRAJECTORIES THROUGH WORD-EMBEDDING SPACES WHOSE COORDINATES REFLECT THE UNIVERSE OF THOUGHTS UNDER CONSIDERATION. MEMORY ENCODING CAN THEN BE MODELLED AS GEOMETRICALLY PRESERVING OR DISTORTING THE 'SHAPE' OF THE ORIGINAL EXPERIENCE. WE APPLIED OUR APPROACH TO DATA COLLECTED AS PARTICIPANTS WATCHED AND VERBALLY RECOUNTED A TELEVISION EPISODE WHILE UNDERGOING FUNCTIONAL NEUROIMAGING. PARTICIPANTS' RECOUNTINGS PRESERVED COARSE SPATIAL PROPERTIES (ESSENTIAL NARRATIVE ELEMENTS) BUT NOT FINE SPATIAL SCALE (LOW-LEVEL) DETAILS OF THE EPISODE'S TRAJECTORY. WE ALSO IDENTIFIED NETWORKS OF BRAIN STRUCTURES SENSITIVE TO THESE TRAJECTORY SHAPES.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
GMEMBEDDINGS: AN R PACKAGE TO APPLY EMBEDDING TECHNIQUES TO MICROBIOME DATA. LARGE-SCALE MICROBIOME STUDIES INVESTIGATING DISEASE-INDUCING MICROBIAL ROLES BASE THEIR FINDINGS ON DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MICROBIAL COUNT DATA IN CONTRASTING ENVIRONMENTS (E.G., STOOL SAMPLES BETWEEN CASES AND CONTROLS). THESE MICROBIOME SURVEY STUDIES ARE OFTEN IMPEDED BY SMALL SAMPLE SIZES AND DATABASE BIAS. COMBINING DATA FROM MULTIPLE SURVEY STUDIES OFTEN RESULTS IN OBVIOUS BATCH EFFECTS, EVEN WHEN DNA PREPARATION AND SEQUENCING METHODS ARE IDENTICAL. RELATEDLY, PREDICTIVE MODELS TRAINED ON ONE MICROBIAL DNA DATASET OFTEN DO NOT GENERALIZE TO OUTSIDE DATASETS. IN THIS STUDY, WE ADDRESS THESE LIMITATIONS BY APPLYING WORD EMBEDDING ALGORITHMS (GLOVE) AND PCA TRANSFORMATION TO ASV DATA FROM THE AMERICAN GUT PROJECT AND GENERATING TRANSLATION MATRICES THAT CAN BE APPLIED TO ANY 16S RRNA V4 REGION GUT MICROBIOME SEQUENCING STUDY. BECAUSE THESE APPROACHES CONTEXTUALIZE MICROBIAL OCCURRENCES IN A LARGER DATASET WHILE REDUCING DIMENSIONALITY OF THE FEATURE SPACE, THEY CAN IMPROVE GENERALIZATION OF PREDICTIVE MODELS THAT PREDICT HOST PHENOTYPE FROM STOOL ASSOCIATED GUT MICROBIOTA. THE GMEMBEDDINGS R PACKAGE CONTAINS GLOVE AND PCA EMBEDDING TRANSFORMATION MATRICES AT 50, 100 AND 250 DIMENSIONS, EACH LEARNED USING APPROXIMATELY 15,000 SAMPLES FROM THE AMERICAN GUT PROJECT. IT CURRENTLY SUPPORTS THE ALIGNMENT, MATCHING, AND MATRIX MULTIPLICATION TO ALLOW USERS TO TRANSFORM THEIR V4 16S RRNA DATA INTO THESE EMBEDDING SPACES. WE SHOW HOW TO CORRELATE THE PROPERTIES IN THE NEW EMBEDDING SPACE TO KEGG FUNCTIONAL PATHWAYS FOR BIOLOGICAL INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS.

GO2VEC: TRANSFORMING GO TERMS AND PROTEINS TO VECTOR REPRESENTATIONS VIA GRAPH EMBEDDINGS. BACKGROUND: SEMANTIC SIMILARITY BETWEEN GENE ONTOLOGY (GO) TERMS IS A FUNDAMENTAL MEASURE FOR MANY BIOINFORMATICS APPLICATIONS, SUCH AS DETERMINING FUNCTIONAL SIMILARITY BETWEEN GENES OR PROTEINS. MOST PREVIOUS RESEARCH EXPLOITED INFORMATION CONTENT TO ESTIMATE THE SEMANTIC SIMILARITY BETWEEN GO TERMS; RECENTLY SOME RESEARCH EXPLOITED WORD EMBEDDINGS TO LEARN VECTOR REPRESENTATIONS FOR GO TERMS FROM A LARGE-SCALE CORPUS. IN THIS PAPER, WE PROPOSED A NOVEL METHOD, NAMED GO2VEC, THAT EXPLOITS GRAPH EMBEDDINGS TO LEARN VECTOR REPRESENTATIONS FOR GO TERMS FROM GO GRAPH. GO2VEC COMBINES THE INFORMATION FROM BOTH GO GRAPH AND GO ANNOTATIONS, AND ITS LEARNED VECTORS CAN BE APPLIED TO A VARIETY OF BIOINFORMATICS APPLICATIONS, SUCH AS CALCULATING FUNCTIONAL SIMILARITY BETWEEN PROTEINS AND PREDICTING PROTEIN-PROTEIN INTERACTIONS. RESULTS: WE CONDUCTED TWO KINDS OF EXPERIMENTS TO EVALUATE THE QUALITY OF GO2VEC: (1) FUNCTIONAL SIMILARITY BETWEEN PROTEINS ON THE COLLABORATIVE EVALUATION OF GO-BASED SEMANTIC SIMILARITY MEASURES (CESSM) DATASET AND (2) PREDICTION OF PROTEIN-PROTEIN INTERACTIONS ON THE YEAST AND HUMAN DATASETS FROM THE STRING DATABASE. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF GO2VEC OVER THE INFORMATION CONTENT-BASED MEASURES AND THE WORD EMBEDDING-BASED MEASURES. CONCLUSION: OUR EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF USING GRAPH EMBEDDINGS TO LEARN VECTOR REPRESENTATIONS FROM UNDIRECTED GO AND GOA GRAPHS. OUR RESULTS ALSO DEMONSTRATE THAT GO ANNOTATIONS PROVIDE USEFUL INFORMATION FOR COMPUTING THE SIMILARITY BETWEEN GO TERMS AND BETWEEN PROTEINS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
GRAPH CONVOLUTIONAL NETWORK DISCRETE HASHING FOR CROSS-MODAL RETRIEVAL. WITH THE RAPID DEVELOPMENT OF DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS, CROSS-MODAL HASHING HAS MADE GREAT PROGRESS. HOWEVER, THE INFORMATION OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF DATA IS ASYMMETRICAL, THAT IS TO SAY, IF THE RESOLUTION OF AN IMAGE IS HIGH ENOUGH, IT CAN REPRODUCE ALMOST 100% OF THE REAL-WORLD SCENES. HOWEVER, TEXT USUALLY CARRIES PERSONAL EMOTION AND IT IS NOT OBJECTIVE ENOUGH, SO WE GENERALLY THINK THAT THE INFORMATION OF IMAGE WILL BE MUCH RICHER THAN TEXT. ALTHOUGH MOST OF THE EXISTING METHODS UNIFY THE SEMANTIC FEATURE EXTRACTION AND HASH FUNCTION LEARNING MODULES FOR END-TO-END LEARNING, THEY IGNORE THIS ISSUE AND DO NOT USE INFORMATION-RICH MODALITIES TO SUPPORT INFORMATION-POOR MODALITIES, LEADING TO SUBOPTIMAL RESULTS, ALTHOUGH THEY UNIFY THE SEMANTIC FEATURE EXTRACTION AND HASH FUNCTION LEARNING MODULES FOR END-TO-END LEARNING. FURTHERMORE, PREVIOUS METHODS LEARN HASH FUNCTIONS IN A RELAXED WAY THAT CAUSES NONTRIVIAL QUANTIZATION LOSSES. TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES, WE PROPOSE A NEW METHOD CALLED GRAPH CONVOLUTIONAL NETWORK (GCN) DISCRETE HASHING. THIS METHOD USES A GCN TO BRIDGE THE INFORMATION GAP BETWEEN DIFFERENT TYPES OF DATA. THE GCN CAN REPRESENT EACH LABEL AS WORD EMBEDDING, WITH THE EMBEDDING REGARDED AS A SET OF INTERDEPENDENT OBJECT CLASSIFIERS. FROM THESE CLASSIFIERS, WE CAN OBTAIN PREDICTED LABELS TO ENHANCE FEATURE REPRESENTATIONS ACROSS MODALITIES. IN ADDITION, WE USE AN EFFICIENT DISCRETE OPTIMIZATION STRATEGY TO LEARN THE DISCRETE BINARY CODES WITHOUT RELAXATION. EXTENSIVE EXPERIMENTS CONDUCTED ON THREE COMMONLY USED DATASETS DEMONSTRATE THAT OUR PROPOSED METHOD GRAPH CONVOLUTIONAL NETWORK-BASED DISCRETE HASHING (GCDH) OUTPERFORMS THE CURRENT STATE-OF-THE-ART CROSS-MODAL HASHING METHODS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
GT-FINDER: CLASSIFY THE FAMILY OF GLUCOSE TRANSPORTERS WITH PRE-TRAINED BERT LANGUAGE MODELS. RECENTLY, LANGUAGE REPRESENTATION MODELS HAVE DRAWN A LOT OF ATTENTION IN THE FIELD OF NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) DUE TO THEIR REMARKABLE RESULTS. AMONG THEM, BERT (BIDIRECTIONAL ENCODER REPRESENTATIONS FROM TRANSFORMERS) HAS PROVEN TO BE A SIMPLE, YET POWERFUL LANGUAGE MODEL THAT HAS ACHIEVED NOVEL STATE-OF-THE-ART PERFORMANCE. BERT ADOPTED THE CONCEPT OF CONTEXTUALIZED WORD EMBEDDINGS TO CAPTURE THE SEMANTICS AND CONTEXT IN WHICH WORDS APPEAR. WE UTILIZED PRE-TRAINED BERT MODELS TO EXTRACT FEATURES FROM PROTEIN SEQUENCES FOR DISCRIMINATING THREE FAMILIES OF GLUCOSE TRANSPORTERS: THE MAJOR FACILITATOR SUPERFAMILY OF GLUCOSE TRANSPORTERS (GLUTS), THE SODIUM-GLUCOSE LINKED TRANSPORTERS (SGLTS), AND THE SUGARS WILL EVENTUALLY BE EXPORTED TRANSPORTERS (SWEETS). WE TREATED PROTEIN SEQUENCES AS SENTENCES AND TRANSFORMED THEM INTO FIXED-LENGTH MEANINGFUL VECTORS WHERE A 768- OR 1024-DIMENSIONAL VECTOR REPRESENTS EACH AMINO ACID. WE OBSERVED THAT BERT-BASE AND BERT-LARGE MODELS IMPROVED THE PERFORMANCE BY MORE THAN 4% IN TERMS OF AVERAGE SENSITIVITY AND MATTHEWS CORRELATION COEFFICIENT (MCC), INDICATING THE EFFICIENCY OF THIS APPROACH. WE ALSO DEVELOPED A BIDIRECTIONAL TRANSFORMER-BASED PROTEIN MODEL (TRANSPORTERSBERT) FOR COMPARISON WITH EXISTING PRE-TRAINED BERT MODELS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
HIERARCHICAL DEEP CLICK FEATURE PREDICTION FOR FINE-GRAINED IMAGE RECOGNITION. THE CLICK FEATURE OF AN IMAGE, DEFINED AS THE USER CLICK FREQUENCY VECTOR OF THE IMAGE ON A PREDEFINED WORD VOCABULARY, IS KNOWN TO EFFECTIVELY REDUCE THE SEMANTIC GAP FOR FINE-GRAINED IMAGE RECOGNITION. UNFORTUNATELY, USER CLICK FREQUENCY DATA ARE USUALLY ABSENT IN PRACTICE. IT REMAINS CHALLENGING TO PREDICT THE CLICK FEATURE FROM THE VISUAL FEATURE, BECAUSE THE USER CLICK FREQUENCY VECTOR OF AN IMAGE IS ALWAYS NOISY AND SPARSE. IN THIS PAPER, WE DEVISE A HIERARCHICAL DEEP WORD EMBEDDING (HDWE) MODEL BY INTEGRATING SPARSE CONSTRAINTS AND AN IMPROVED RELU OPERATOR TO ADDRESS CLICK FEATURE PREDICTION FROM VISUAL FEATURES. HDWE IS A COARSE-TO-FINE CLICK FEATURE PREDICTOR THAT IS LEARNED WITH THE HELP OF AN AUXILIARY IMAGE DATASET CONTAINING CLICK INFORMATION. IT CAN THEREFORE DISCOVER THE HIERARCHY OF WORD SEMANTICS. WE EVALUATE HDWE ON THREE DOG AND ONE BIRD IMAGE DATASETS, IN WHICH CLICKTURE-DOG AND CLICKTURE-BIRD ARE UTILIZED AS AUXILIARY DATASETS TO PROVIDE CLICK DATA, RESPECTIVELY. OUR EMPIRICAL STUDIES SHOW THAT HDWE HAS 1) HIGHER RECOGNITION ACCURACY, 2) A LARGER COMPRESSION RATIO, AND 3) GOOD ONE-SHOT LEARNING ABILITY AND SCALABILITY TO UNSEEN CATEGORIES.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
HIERARCHICAL-TASK RESERVOIR FOR ONLINE SEMANTIC ANALYSIS FROM CONTINUOUS SPEECH. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE PROPOSE A NOVEL ARCHITECTURE CALLED HIERARCHICAL-TASK RESERVOIR (HTR) SUITABLE FOR REAL-TIME APPLICATIONS FOR WHICH DIFFERENT LEVELS OF ABSTRACTION ARE AVAILABLE. WE APPLY IT TO SEMANTIC ROLE LABELING (SRL) BASED ON CONTINUOUS SPEECH RECOGNITION. TAKING INSPIRATION FROM THE BRAIN, THIS DEMONSTRATES THE HIERARCHIES OF REPRESENTATIONS FROM PERCEPTIVE TO INTEGRATIVE AREAS, AND WE CONSIDER A HIERARCHY OF FOUR SUBTASKS WITH INCREASING LEVELS OF ABSTRACTION (PHONE, WORD, PART-OF-SPEECH (POS), AND SEMANTIC ROLE TAGS). THESE TASKS ARE PROGRESSIVELY LEARNED BY THE LAYERS OF THE HTR ARCHITECTURE. INTERESTINGLY, QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE HIERARCHICAL-TASK APPROACH PROVIDES AN ADVANTAGE TO IMPROVE THE PREDICTION. IN PARTICULAR, THE QUALITATIVE RESULTS SHOW THAT A SHALLOW OR A HIERARCHICAL RESERVOIR, CONSIDERED AS BASELINES, DOES NOT PRODUCE ESTIMATIONS AS GOOD AS THE HTR MODEL WOULD. MOREOVER, WE SHOW THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO FURTHER IMPROVE THE ACCURACY OF THE MODEL BY DESIGNING SKIP CONNECTIONS AND BY CONSIDERING WORD EMBEDDING (WE) IN THE INTERNAL REPRESENTATIONS. OVERALL, THE HTR OUTPERFORMED THE OTHER STATE-OF-THE-ART RESERVOIR-BASED APPROACHES AND IT RESULTED IN EXTREMELY EFFICIENT WITH RESPECT TO TYPICAL RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORKS (RNNS) IN DEEP LEARNING (DL) [E.G., LONG SHORT TERM MEMORY (LSTMS)]. THE HTR ARCHITECTURE IS PROPOSED AS A STEP TOWARD THE MODELING OF ONLINE AND HIERARCHICAL PROCESSES AT WORK IN THE BRAIN DURING LANGUAGE COMPREHENSION.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
HYBRID DEEP LEARNING FOR MEDICATION-RELATED INFORMATION EXTRACTION FROM CLINICAL TEXTS IN FRENCH: MEDEXT ALGORITHM DEVELOPMENT STUDY. BACKGROUND: INFORMATION RELATED TO PATIENT MEDICATION IS CRUCIAL FOR HEALTH CARE; HOWEVER, UP TO 80% OF THE INFORMATION RESIDES SOLELY IN UNSTRUCTURED TEXT. MANUAL EXTRACTION IS DIFFICULT AND TIME-CONSUMING, AND THERE IS NOT A LOT OF RESEARCH ON NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING EXTRACTING MEDICAL INFORMATION FROM UNSTRUCTURED TEXT FROM FRENCH CORPORA. OBJECTIVE: WE AIMED TO DEVELOP A SYSTEM TO EXTRACT MEDICATION-RELATED INFORMATION FROM CLINICAL TEXT WRITTEN IN FRENCH. METHODS: WE DEVELOPED A HYBRID SYSTEM COMBINING AN EXPERT RULE-BASED SYSTEM, CONTEXTUAL WORD EMBEDDING (EMBEDDING FOR LANGUAGE MODEL) TRAINED ON CLINICAL NOTES, AND A DEEP RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORK (BIDIRECTIONAL LONG SHORT TERM MEMORY-CONDITIONAL RANDOM FIELD). THE TASK CONSISTED OF EXTRACTING DRUG MENTIONS AND THEIR RELATED INFORMATION (EG, DOSAGE, FREQUENCY, DURATION, ROUTE, CONDITION). WE MANUALLY ANNOTATED 320 CLINICAL NOTES FROM A FRENCH CLINICAL DATA WAREHOUSE TO TRAIN AND EVALUATE THE MODEL. WE COMPARED THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR APPROACH TO THOSE OF STANDARD APPROACHES: RULE-BASED OR MACHINE LEARNING ONLY AND CLASSIC WORD EMBEDDINGS. WE EVALUATED THE MODELS USING TOKEN-LEVEL RECALL, PRECISION, AND F-MEASURE. RESULTS: THE OVERALL F-MEASURE WAS 89.9% (PRECISION 90.8; RECALL: 89.2) WHEN COMBINING EXPERT RULES AND CONTEXTUALIZED EMBEDDINGS, COMPARED TO 88.1% (PRECISION 89.5; RECALL 87.2) WITHOUT EXPERT RULES OR CONTEXTUALIZED EMBEDDINGS. THE F-MEASURES FOR EACH CATEGORY WERE 95.3% FOR MEDICATION NAME, 64.4% FOR DRUG CLASS MENTIONS, 95.3% FOR DOSAGE, 92.2% FOR FREQUENCY, 78.8% FOR DURATION, AND 62.2% FOR CONDITION OF THE INTAKE. CONCLUSIONS: ASSOCIATING EXPERT RULES, DEEP CONTEXTUALIZED EMBEDDING, AND DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS IMPROVED MEDICATION INFORMATION EXTRACTION.

IACVP: MARKEDLY ENHANCED IDENTIFICATION OF ANTI-CORONAVIRUS PEPTIDES USING A DATASET-SPECIFIC WORD2VEC MODEL. THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC CAUSED SEVERAL MILLION DEATHS WORLDWIDE. DEVELOPMENT OF ANTI-CORONAVIRUS DRUGS IS THUS URGENT. UNLIKE CONVENTIONAL NON-PEPTIDE DRUGS, ANTIVIRAL PEPTIDE DRUGS ARE HIGHLY SPECIFIC, EASY TO SYNTHESIZE AND MODIFY, AND NOT HIGHLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO DRUG RESISTANCE. TO REDUCE THE TIME AND EXPENSE INVOLVED IN SCREENING THOUSANDS OF PEPTIDES AND ASSAYING THEIR ANTIVIRAL ACTIVITY, COMPUTATIONAL PREDICTORS FOR IDENTIFYING ANTI-CORONAVIRUS PEPTIDES (ACVPS) ARE NEEDED. HOWEVER, FEW EXPERIMENTALLY VERIFIED ACVP SAMPLES ARE AVAILABLE, EVEN THOUGH A RELATIVELY LARGE NUMBER OF ANTIVIRAL PEPTIDES (AVPS) HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED. IN THIS STUDY, WE ATTEMPTED TO PREDICT ACVPS USING AN AVP DATASET AND A SMALL COLLECTION OF ACVPS. USING CONVENTIONAL FEATURES, A BINARY PROFILE AND A WORD-EMBEDDING WORD2VEC (W2V), WE SYSTEMATICALLY EXPLORED FIVE DIFFERENT MACHINE LEARNING METHODS: TRANSFORMER, CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK, BIDIRECTIONAL LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY, RANDOM FOREST (RF) AND SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE. VIA EXHAUSTIVE SEARCHES, WE FOUND THAT THE RF CLASSIFIER WITH W2V CONSISTENTLY ACHIEVED BETTER PERFORMANCE ON DIFFERENT DATASETS. THE TWO MAIN CONTROLLING FACTORS WERE: (I) THE DATASET-SPECIFIC W2V DICTIONARY WAS GENERATED FROM THE TRAINING AND INDEPENDENT TEST DATASETS INSTEAD OF THE WIDELY USED GENERAL UNIPROT PROTEOME AND (II) A SYSTEMATIC SEARCH WAS CONDUCTED AND DETERMINED THE OPTIMAL K-MER VALUE IN W2V, WHICH PROVIDES GREATER DISCRIMINATION BETWEEN POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE SAMPLES. THEREFORE, OUR PROPOSED METHOD, NAMED IACVP, CONSISTENTLY PROVIDES BETTER PREDICTION PERFORMANCE COMPARED WITH EXISTING STATE-OF-THE-ART METHODS. TO ASSIST EXPERIMENTALISTS IN IDENTIFYING PUTATIVE ACVPS, WE IMPLEMENTED OUR MODEL AS A WEB SERVER ACCESSIBLE VIA THE FOLLOWING LINK: HTTP://KURATA35.BIO.KYUTECH.AC.JP/IACVP.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
IDENTIFICATION AND CLASSIFICATION OF DEPRESSED MENTAL STATE FOR END-USER OVER SOCIAL MEDIA. IN RESEARCHING SOCIAL NETWORK DATA AND DEPRESSION, IT IS OFTEN NECESSARY TO MANUALLY LABEL DEPRESSED AND NON-DEPRESSED USERS, WHICH IS TIME-CONSUMING AND LABOR-INTENSIVE. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY IS THAT IT EXPLORES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SOCIAL NETWORK DATA AND DEPRESSION. IT CAN ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO DETECTING AND IDENTIFYING DEPRESSION. THROUGH COLLECTING AND ANALYZING COLLEGE STUDENTS' MICROBLOG SOCIAL DATA, A PRELIMINARY SCREENING ALGORITHM FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS' SUSPECTED DEPRESSION MICROBLOGS BASED ON DEPRESSION KEYWORDS, AND SEMANTIC EXPANSION IS RESEARCHED; A COMPREHENSIVE LEXICAL GRAMMAR WAS PROPOSED. THIS RESEARCH PROVIDED HAS A PRELIMINARY SCREENING METHOD BASED ON DEPRESSION KEYWORDS AND SEMANTIC EXPANSION FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS' SUSPECTED DEPRESSION MICROBLOGS, WITH A SCREENING ACCURACY. THIS METHOD FORMS A DEPRESSION KEYWORD TABLE BY CONSTRUCTING THE BASIC KEYWORD TABLE AND THE SEMANTIC EXPANSION BASED ON THE WORD EMBEDDING LEARNING MODEL WORD2VEC. FINALLY, THE WORD TABLE IS USED TO CALCULATE THE SEMANTIC SIMILARITY OF THE TESTED MICROBLOGS AND THEN IDENTIFY WHETHER IT IS A SUSPECTED DEPRESSION MICROBLOG. THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS ON THE MICROBLOG DATASET OF COLLEGE STUDENTS SHOW THAT THE COMPREHENSIVE LEXICAL METHOD IS BETTER THAN THE SDS QUESTIONNAIRE SEGMENTATION METHOD AND THE EXPERT LEXICAL METHOD IN TERMS OF SCREENING ACCURACY; THE COMPREHENSIVE LEXICAL APPROACH CAN QUICKLY AND AUTOMATICALLY SCREEN OUT A TINY PROPORTION OF SUSPECTED DOUBTS FROM A LARGE NUMBER OF COLLEGE STUDENTS' MICROBLOGS. DEPRESSION WEIBO CAN REDUCE THE WORKLOAD OF EXPERTS' ANNOTATION, IMPROVE ANNOTATION EFFICIENCY, AND PROVIDE A SUITABLE DATA PROCESSING BASIS FOR THE SUBSEQUENT ACCURATE IDENTIFICATION (CLASSIFICATION PROBLEM) OF PATIENTS WITH DEPRESSION.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
IDENTIFICATION OF SIMILAR PATIENTS THROUGH MEDICAL CONCEPT EMBEDDING FROM ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS: A FEASIBILITY STUDY FOR RARE DISEASE DIAGNOSIS. TO IDENTIFY PATIENTS WITH SIMILAR CLINICAL PROFILES AND DERIVE INSIGHTS FROM THE RECORDS AND OUTCOMES OF SIMILAR PATIENTS CAN HELP FAST AND PRECISE DIAGNOSIS AND OTHER CLINICAL DECISIONS FOR RARE DISEASES. SIMILARITY METHODS ARE REQUIRED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE SEMANTIC RELATIONS BETWEEN MEDICAL CONCEPTS AND ALSO THE DIFFERENT RELEVANCE OF ALL MEDICAL CONCEPTS PRESENTED IN PATIENTS' MEDICAL RECORDS. IN THIS PAPER, WE INTRODUCE THE METHODS DEVELOPED IN THE CONTEXT OF RARE DISEASE SCREENING/DIAGNOSIS FROM CLINICAL DATA WAREHOUSE USING MEDICAL CONCEPT EMBEDDING AND ADJUSTED AGGREGATIONS. OUR METHODS PROVIDED BETTER PRELIMINARY RESULTS THAN BASELINE METHODS, WITH A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT OF PRECISION AMONG THE TOP RANKED SIMILAR PATIENTS, WHICH IS ENCOURAGING FOR FURTHER FINE-TUNING AND APPLICATION ON A LARGE-SCALE DATASET FOR NEW/CANDIDATE PATIENT IDENTIFICATION.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
IDENTIFYING ANTIMICROBIAL PEPTIDES USING WORD EMBEDDING WITH DEEP RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORKS. MOTIVATION: ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE CONSTITUTES A MAJOR PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS, AND FINDING NEW SOURCES OF ANTIMICROBIAL DRUGS IS CRUCIAL TO SOLVING IT. BACTERIOCINS, WHICH ARE BACTERIALLY PRODUCED ANTIMICROBIAL PEPTIDE PRODUCTS, ARE CANDIDATES FOR BROADENING THE AVAILABLE CHOICES OF ANTIMICROBIALS. HOWEVER, THE DISCOVERY OF NEW BACTERIOCINS BY GENOMIC MINING IS HAMPERED BY THEIR SEQUENCES' LOW COMPLEXITY AND HIGH VARIANCE, WHICH FRUSTRATES SEQUENCE SIMILARITY-BASED SEARCHES. RESULTS: HERE WE USE WORD EMBEDDINGS OF PROTEIN SEQUENCES TO REPRESENT BACTERIOCINS, AND APPLY A WORD EMBEDDING METHOD THAT ACCOUNTS FOR AMINO ACID ORDER IN PROTEIN SEQUENCES, TO PREDICT NOVEL BACTERIOCINS FROM PROTEIN SEQUENCES WITHOUT USING SEQUENCE SIMILARITY. OUR METHOD PREDICTS, WITH A HIGH PROBABILITY, SIX YET UNKNOWN PUTATIVE BACTERIOCINS IN LACTOBACILLUS. GENERALIZED, THE REPRESENTATION OF SEQUENCES WITH WORD EMBEDDINGS PRESERVING SEQUENCE ORDER INFORMATION CAN BE APPLIED TO PEPTIDE AND PROTEIN CLASSIFICATION PROBLEMS FOR WHICH SEQUENCE SIMILARITY CANNOT BE USED.

IDENTIFYING DIABETES IN CLINICAL NOTES IN HEBREW: A NOVEL TEXT CLASSIFICATION APPROACH BASED ON WORD EMBEDDING. NIMBLEMINER IS A WORD EMBEDDING-BASED, LANGUAGE-AGNOSTIC NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING SYSTEM FOR CLINICAL TEXT CLASSIFICATION. PREVIOUSLY, NIMBLEMINER WAS APPLIED IN ENGLISH AND THIS STUDY APPLIED NIMBLEMINER ON A LARGE SAMPLE OF INPATIENT CLINICAL NOTES IN HEBREW TO IDENTIFY INSTANCES OF DIABETES MELLITUS. THE STUDY DATA INCLUDED 521,278 CLINICAL NOTES (ONE ADMISSION AND ONE DISCHARGE NOTE PER PATIENT) FOR 268,664 HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS TO MEDICAL-SURGICAL UNITS OF A LARGE HOSPITAL IN ISRAEL. NIMBLEMINER ACHIEVED OVERALL GOOD PERFORMANCE (F-SCORE =.94) WHEN TESTED ON A GOLD STANDARD HUMAN ANNOTATED DATASET OF 800 CLINICAL NOTES. WE FOUND 15% MORE PATIENTS WITH DIABETES MENTIONED IN THE CLINICAL NOTES COMPARED WITH DIAGNOSES DATA. OUR FINDINGS ABOUT UNDERREPORTING OF DIABETES IN THE CODED DIAGNOSES DATA HIGHLIGHT THE URGENT NEED FOR TOOLS AND ALGORITHMS THAT WILL HELP BUSY PROVIDERS IDENTIFY A RANGE OF USEFUL INFORMATION, LIKE HAVING A DIABETES.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
IDENTIFYING DNA N4-METHYLCYTOSINE SITES IN THE ROSACEAE GENOME WITH A DEEP LEARNING MODEL RELYING ON DISTRIBUTED FEATURE REPRESENTATION. DNA N4-METHYLCYTOSINE (4MC), AN EPIGENETIC MODIFICATION FOUND IN PROKARYOTIC AND EUKARYOTIC SPECIES, IS INVOLVED IN NUMEROUS BIOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS, INCLUDING HOST DEFENSE, TRANSCRIPTION REGULATION, GENE EXPRESSION, AND DNA REPLICATION. TO IDENTIFY 4MC SITES, PREVIOUS COMPUTATIONAL STUDIES MOSTLY FOCUSED ON FINDING HAND-CRAFTED FEATURES. THIS AREA OF RESEARCH, THEREFORE, WOULD BENEFIT FROM THE DEVELOPMENT OF A COMPUTATIONAL APPROACH THAT RELIES ON AUTOMATIC FEATURE SELECTION TO IDENTIFY RELEVANT SITES. WE HERE REPORT 4MC-W2VEC, A COMPUTATIONAL METHOD THAT LEARNED AUTOMATIC FEATURE DISCRIMINATION IN THE ROSACEAE GENOMES, ESPECIALLY IN ROSA CHINENSIS (R. CHINENSIS) AND FRAGARIA VESCA (F. VESCA), BASED ON DISTRIBUTED FEATURE REPRESENTATION AND THROUGH THE WORD EMBEDDING TECHNIQUE 'WORD2VEC'. WHILE A FEW BIOINFORMATICS TOOLS ARE CURRENTLY EMPLOYED TO IDENTIFY 4MC SITES IN THESE GENOMES, THEIR PREDICTION PERFORMANCE IS INADEQUATE. OUR SYSTEM PROCESSED 4MC AND NON-4MC SITES THROUGH A WORD EMBEDDING PROCESS, INCLUDING SUB-WORD INFORMATION OF ITS BIOLOGICAL WORDS THROUGH K-MER, WHICH THEN SERVED AS FEATURES THAT WERE FED INTO A DOUBLE LAYER OF CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (CNN) TO CLASSIFY WHETHER THE SAMPLE SEQUENCES CONTAINED 4MCS OR NON-4MCS SITES. OUR TOOL DEMONSTRATED PERFORMANCE SUPERIOR TO CURRENT TOOLS THAT USE THE SAME GENOMIC DATASETS. ADDITIONALLY, 4MC-W2VEC IS EFFECTIVE FOR BALANCED AND IMBALANCED CLASS DATASETS ALIKE, AND THE ONLINE WEB-SERVER IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE AT: HTTP://NSCLBIO.JBNU.AC.KR/TOOLS/4MC-W2VEC/.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
IDENTIFYING FUNCTIONS OF PROTEINS IN MICE WITH FUNCTIONAL EMBEDDING FEATURES. IN CURRENT BIOLOGY, EXPLORING THE BIOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS OF PROTEINS IS IMPORTANT. GIVEN THE LARGE NUMBER OF PROTEINS IN SOME ORGANISMS, EXPLORING THEIR FUNCTIONS ONE BY ONE THROUGH TRADITIONAL EXPERIMENTS IS IMPOSSIBLE. THEREFORE, DEVELOPING QUICK AND RELIABLE METHODS FOR IDENTIFYING PROTEIN FUNCTIONS IS NECESSARY. CONSIDERABLE ACCUMULATION OF PROTEIN KNOWLEDGE AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS ON COMPUTER SCIENCE PROVIDE AN ALTERNATIVE WAY TO COMPLETE THIS TASK, THAT IS, DESIGNING COMPUTATIONAL METHODS. SEVERAL EFFORTS HAVE BEEN MADE IN THIS FIELD. MOST PREVIOUS METHODS HAVE ADOPTED THE PROTEIN SEQUENCE FEATURES OR DIRECTLY USED THE LINKAGE FROM A PROTEIN-PROTEIN INTERACTION (PPI) NETWORK. IN THIS STUDY, WE PROPOSED SOME NOVEL MULTI-LABEL CLASSIFIERS, WHICH ADOPTED NEW EMBEDDING FEATURES TO REPRESENT PROTEINS. THESE FEATURES WERE DERIVED FROM FUNCTIONAL DOMAINS AND A PPI NETWORK VIA WORD EMBEDDING AND NETWORK EMBEDDING, RESPECTIVELY. THE MINIMUM REDUNDANCY MAXIMUM RELEVANCE METHOD WAS USED TO ASSESS THE FEATURES, GENERATING A FEATURE LIST. INCREMENTAL FEATURE SELECTION, INCORPORATING RANDOM K-LABELSETS TO CONSTRUCT MULTI-LABEL CLASSIFIERS, USED SUCH LIST TO CONSTRUCT TWO OPTIMUM CLASSIFIERS, CORRESPONDING TO TWO KEY MEASUREMENTS: ACCURACY AND EXACT MATCH. THESE TWO CLASSIFIERS HAD GOOD PERFORMANCE, AND THEY WERE SUPERIOR TO CLASSIFIERS THAT USED FEATURES EXTRACTED BY TRADITIONAL METHODS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
IDENTIFYING HEALTH RELATED OCCUPATIONS OF TWITTER USERS THROUGH WORD EMBEDDING AND DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS. BACKGROUND: TWITTER IS A POPULAR SOCIAL NETWORKING SITE WHERE SHORT MESSAGES OR "TWEETS" OF USERS HAVE BEEN USED EXTENSIVELY FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES. HOWEVER, NOT MUCH RESEARCH HAS BEEN DONE IN MINING THE MEDICAL PROFESSIONS, SUCH AS DETECTING THE OCCUPATIONS OF USERS FROM THEIR BIOGRAPHICAL CONTENTS. MINING SUCH PROFESSIONS CAN BE USED TO BUILD EFFICIENT RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS FOR COST-EFFECTIVE TARGETED ADVERTISEMENTS. MOREOVER, IT IS HIGHLY IMPORTANT TO DEVELOP EFFECTIVE METHODS TO IDENTIFY THE OCCUPATION OF USERS SINCE CONVENTIONAL CLASSIFICATION METHODS RELY ON FEATURES DEVELOPED BY HUMAN INTELLIGENCE. ALTHOUGH, THE RESULT MAY BE FAVORABLE FOR THE CLASSIFICATION PROBLEM. HOWEVER, IT IS STILL EXTREMELY CHALLENGING FOR TRADITIONAL CLASSIFIERS TO PREDICT THE MEDICAL OCCUPATIONS ACCURATELY SINCE IT INVOLVES PREDICTING MULTIPLE OCCUPATIONS. HENCE THIS STUDY EMPHASIZES PREDICTING THE MEDICAL OCCUPATIONAL CLASS OF USERS THROUGH THEIR PUBLIC BIOGRAPHICAL ("BIO") CONTENT. WE HAVE CONDUCTED OUR ANALYSIS BY ANNOTATING THE BIO CONTENT OF TWITTER USERS. IN THIS PAPER, WE PROPOSE A METHOD OF COMBINING WORD EMBEDDING WITH STATE-OF-ART NEURAL NETWORK MODELS THAT INCLUDE: LONG SHORT TERM MEMORY (LSTM), BIDIRECTIONAL LSTM, GATED RECURRENT UNIT, BIDIRECTIONAL ENCODER REPRESENTATIONS FROM TRANSFORMERS, AND A LITE BERT. MOREOVER, WE HAVE ALSO OBSERVED THAT BY COMPOSING THE WORD EMBEDDING WITH THE NEURAL NETWORK MODELS THERE IS NO NEED TO CONSTRUCT ANY PARTICULAR ATTRIBUTE OR FEATURE. BY USING WORD EMBEDDING, THE BIO CONTENTS ARE FORMATTED AS DENSE VECTORS WHICH ARE FED AS INPUT INTO THE NEURAL NETWORK MODELS AS A SEQUENCE OF VECTORS. RESULT: PERFORMANCE METRICS THAT INCLUDE ACCURACY, PRECISION, RECALL, AND F1-SCORE HAVE SHOWN A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OUR METHOD OF COMBINING WORD EMBEDDING WITH NEURAL NETWORK MODELS THAN WITH THE TRADITIONAL METHODS. THE SCORES HAVE PROVED THAT OUR PROPOSED APPROACH HAS OUTPERFORMED THE TRADITIONAL MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES FOR DETECTING MEDICAL OCCUPATIONS AMONG USERS. ALBERT HAS PERFORMED THE BEST AMONG THE DEEP LEARNING NETWORKS WITH AN F1 SCORE OF 0.90. CONCLUSION: IN THIS STUDY, WE HAVE PRESENTED A NOVEL METHOD OF DETECTING THE OCCUPATIONS OF TWITTER USERS ENGAGED IN THE MEDICAL DOMAIN BY MERGING WORD EMBEDDING WITH STATE-OF-ART NEURAL NETWORKS. THE OUTCOMES OF OUR APPROACH HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT OUR METHOD CAN FURTHER ADVANCE THE PROCESS OF ANALYZING CORPORA OF SOCIAL MEDIA WITHOUT GOING THROUGH THE TROUBLE OF DEVELOPING COMPUTATIONALLY EXPENSIVE FEATURES.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
IDENTIFYING INSOMNIA FROM SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS: PSYCHOLINGUISTIC ANALYSES OF USER TWEETS. BACKGROUND: MANY PEOPLE SUFFER FROM INSOMNIA, A SLEEP DISORDER CHARACTERIZED BY DIFFICULTY FALLING AND STAYING ASLEEP DURING THE NIGHT. AS SOCIAL MEDIA HAVE BECOME A UBIQUITOUS PLATFORM TO SHARE USERS' THOUGHTS, OPINIONS, ACTIVITIES, AND PREFERENCES WITH THEIR FRIENDS AND ACQUAINTANCES, THE SHARED CONTENT ACROSS THESE PLATFORMS CAN BE USED TO DIAGNOSE DIFFERENT HEALTH PROBLEMS, INCLUDING INSOMNIA. ONLY A FEW RECENT STUDIES HAVE EXAMINED THE PREDICTION OF INSOMNIA FROM TWITTER DATA, AND WE FOUND RESEARCH GAPS IN PREDICTING INSOMNIA FROM WORD USAGE PATTERNS AND CORRELATIONS BETWEEN USERS' INSOMNIA AND THEIR BIG 5 PERSONALITY TRAITS AS DERIVED FROM SOCIAL MEDIA INTERACTIONS. OBJECTIVE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO BUILD AN INSOMNIA PREDICTION MODEL FROM USERS' PSYCHOLINGUISTIC PATTERNS, INCLUDING THE ELEMENTS OF WORD USAGE, SEMANTICS, AND THEIR BIG 5 PERSONALITY TRAITS AS DERIVED FROM TWEETS. METHODS: IN THIS PAPER, WE EXPLOITED BOTH PSYCHOLINGUISTIC AND PERSONALITY TRAITS DERIVED FROM TWEETS TO IDENTIFY INSOMNIA PATIENTS. FIRST, WE BUILT PSYCHOLINGUISTIC PROFILES OF THE USERS FROM THEIR WORD CHOICES AND THE SEMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE WORDS OF THEIR TWEETS. WE THEN DETERMINED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A USERS' PERSONALITY TRAITS AND INSOMNIA. FINALLY, WE BUILT A DOUBLE-WEIGHTED ENSEMBLE CLASSIFICATION MODEL TO PREDICT INSOMNIA FROM BOTH PSYCHOLINGUISTIC AND PERSONALITY TRAITS AS DERIVED FROM USER TWEETS. RESULTS: OUR CLASSIFICATION MODEL SHOWED STRONG PREDICTION POTENTIAL (78.8%) TO PREDICT INSOMNIA FROM TWEETS. AS INSOMNIACS ARE GENERALLY ILL-TEMPERED AND FEEL MORE STRESS AND MENTAL EXHAUSTION, WE OBSERVED SIGNIFICANT CORRELATIONS OF CERTAIN WORD USAGE PATTERNS AMONG THEM. THEY TEND TO USE NEGATIVE WORDS (EG, "NO," "NOT," "NEVER"). SOME PEOPLE FREQUENTLY USE SWEAR WORDS (EG, "DAMN," "PISS," "FUCK") WITH STRONG TEMPERAMENT. THEY ALSO USE ANXIOUS (EG, "WORRIED," "FEARFUL," "NERVOUS") AND SAD (EG, "CRYING," "GRIEF," "SAD") WORDS IN THEIR TWEETS. WE ALSO FOUND THAT THE USERS WITH HIGH NEUROTICISM AND CONSCIENTIOUSNESS SCORES FOR THE BIG 5 PERSONALITY TRAITS LIKELY HAVE STRONG CORRELATIONS WITH INSOMNIA. ADDITIONALLY, WE OBSERVED THAT USERS WITH HIGH CONSCIENTIOUSNESS SCORES HAVE STRONG CORRELATIONS WITH INSOMNIA PATTERNS, WHILE NEGATIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN EXTRAVERSION AND INSOMNIA WAS ALSO FOUND. CONCLUSIONS: OUR MODEL CAN HELP PREDICT INSOMNIA FROM USERS' SOCIAL MEDIA INTERACTIONS. THUS, INCORPORATING OUR MODEL INTO A SOFTWARE SYSTEM CAN HELP FAMILY MEMBERS DETECT INSOMNIA PROBLEMS IN INDIVIDUALS BEFORE THEY BECOME WORSE. THE SOFTWARE SYSTEM CAN ALSO HELP DOCTORS TO DIAGNOSE POSSIBLE INSOMNIA IN PATIENTS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
IDENTIFYING PUPYLATION PROTEINS AND SITES BY INCORPORATING MULTIPLE METHODS. PUPYLATION IS AN IMPORTANT POSTTRANSLATIONAL MODIFICATION IN PROTEINS AND PLAYS A KEY ROLE IN THE CELL FUNCTION OF MICROORGANISMS; AN ACCURATE PREDICTION OF PUPYLATION PROTEINS AND SPECIFIED SITES IS OF GREAT SIGNIFICANCE FOR THE STUDY OF BASIC BIOLOGICAL PROCESSES AND DEVELOPMENT OF RELATED DRUGS SINCE IT WOULD GREATLY SAVE EXPERIMENTAL COSTS AND IMPROVE WORK EFFICIENCY. IN THIS WORK, WE FIRST CONSTRUCTED A MODEL FOR IDENTIFYING PUPYLATION PROTEINS. TO IMPROVE THE PUPYLATION PROTEIN PREDICTION MODEL, THE KNN SCORING MATRIX MODEL BASED ON FUNCTIONAL DOMAIN GO ANNOTATION AND THE WORD EMBEDDING MODEL WERE USED TO EXTRACT THE FEATURES AND RANDOM UNDER-SAMPLING (RUS) AND SYNTHETIC MINORITY OVER-SAMPLING TECHNIQUE (SMOTE) WERE APPLIED TO BALANCE THE DATASET. FINALLY, THE BALANCED DATA SETS WERE INPUT INTO EXTREME GRADIENT BOOSTING (XGBOOST). THE PERFORMANCE OF 10-FOLD CROSS-VALIDATION SHOWS THAT ACCURACY (ACC), MATTHEW'S CORRELATION COEFFICIENT (MCC), AND AREA UNDER THE ROC CURVE (AUC) ARE 95.23%, 0.8100, AND 0.9864, RESPECTIVELY. FOR THE PUPYLATION SITE PREDICTION MODEL, SIX FEATURE EXTRACTION CODES (I.E., TPC, AAI, ONE-HOT, PSEAAC, CKSAAP, AND WORD EMBEDDING) SERVED TO EXTRACT PROTEIN SEQUENCE FEATURES, AND THE CHI-SQUARE TEST WAS EMPLOYED FOR FEATURE SELECTION. RIGOROUS 10-FOLD CROSS-VALIDATIONS INDICATED THAT THE ACCURACIES ARE VERY HIGH AND OUTPERFORMED ITS EXISTING COUNTERPARTS. FINALLY, FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF RESEARCHERS, PUP-PS-FUSE HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED AT HTTPS://BIOINFO.JCU.EDU.CN/PUP-PS-FUSE AND HTTP://121.36.221.79/PUP-PS-FUSE/AS A BACKUP.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
IDENTIFYING SNARES BY INCORPORATING DEEP LEARNING ARCHITECTURE AND AMINO ACID EMBEDDING REPRESENTATION. SNARES (SOLUBLE N-ETHYLMALEIMIDE-SENSITIVE FACTOR ACTIVATING PROTEIN RECEPTORS) ARE A GROUP OF PROTEINS THAT ARE CRUCIAL FOR MEMBRANE FUSION AND EXOCYTOSIS OF NEUROTRANSMITTERS FROM THE CELL. THEY PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN A BROAD RANGE OF CELL PROCESSES, INCLUDING CELL GROWTH, CYTOKINESIS, AND SYNAPTIC TRANSMISSION, TO PROMOTE CELL MEMBRANE INTEGRATION IN EUKARYOTES. MANY STUDIES DETERMINED THAT SNARE PROTEINS HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH A LOT OF HUMAN DISEASES, ESPECIALLY IN CANCER. THEREFORE, IDENTIFYING THEIR FUNCTIONS IS A CHALLENGING PROBLEM FOR SCIENTISTS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE CANCER DISEASE AS WELL AS DESIGN THE DRUG TARGETS FOR TREATMENT. WE DESCRIBED EACH PROTEIN SEQUENCE BASED ON THE AMINO ACID EMBEDDINGS USING FASTTEXT, WHICH IS A NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING MODEL PERFORMING WELL IN ITS FIELD. BECAUSE EACH PROTEIN SEQUENCE IS SIMILAR TO A SENTENCE WITH DIFFERENT WORDS, APPLYING LANGUAGE MODEL INTO PROTEIN SEQUENCE IS CHALLENGING AND PROMISING. AFTER GENERATING, THE AMINO ACID EMBEDDING FEATURES WERE FED INTO A DEEP LEARNING ALGORITHM FOR PREDICTION. OUR MODEL WHICH COMBINES FASTTEXT MODEL AND DEEP CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS COULD IDENTIFY SNARE PROTEINS WITH AN INDEPENDENT TEST ACCURACY OF 92.8%, SENSITIVITY OF 88.5%, SPECIFICITY OF 97%, AND MATTHEWS CORRELATION COEFFICIENT (MCC) OF 0.86. OUR PERFORMANCE RESULTS WERE SUPERIOR TO THE STATE-OF-THE-ART PREDICTOR (SNARE-CNN). WE SUGGEST THIS STUDY AS A RELIABLE METHOD FOR BIOLOGISTS FOR SNARE IDENTIFICATION AND IT SERVES A BASIS FOR APPLYING FASTTEXT WORD EMBEDDING MODEL INTO BIOINFORMATICS, ESPECIALLY IN PROTEIN SEQUENCING PREDICTION.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
IDENTIFYING SYNONYMY BETWEEN RELATIONAL PHRASES USING WORD EMBEDDINGS. MANY TEXT MINING APPLICATIONS IN THE BIOMEDICAL DOMAIN BENEFIT FROM AUTOMATIC CLUSTERING OF RELATIONAL PHRASES INTO SYNONYMOUS GROUPS, SINCE IT ALLEVIATES THE PROBLEM OF SPURIOUS MISMATCHES CAUSED BY THE DIVERSITY OF NATURAL LANGUAGE EXPRESSIONS. MOST OF THE PREVIOUS WORK THAT HAS ADDRESSED THIS TASK OF SYNONYMY RESOLUTION USES SIMILARITY METRICS BETWEEN RELATIONAL PHRASES BASED ON TEXTUAL STRINGS OR DEPENDENCY PATHS, WHICH, FOR THE MOST PART, IGNORE THE CONTEXT AROUND THE RELATIONS. TO OVERCOME THIS SHORTCOMING, WE EMPLOY A WORD EMBEDDING TECHNIQUE TO ENCODE RELATIONAL PHRASES. WE THEN APPLY THE K-MEANS ALGORITHM ON TOP OF THE DISTRIBUTIONAL REPRESENTATIONS TO CLUSTER THE PHRASES. OUR EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS SHOW THAT THIS APPROACH OUTPERFORMS STATE-OF-THE-ART STATISTICAL MODELS INCLUDING LATENT DIRICHLET ALLOCATION AND MARKOV LOGIC NETWORKS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
IDENTIFYING THE PERCEIVED SEVERITY OF PATIENT-GENERATED TELEMEDICAL QUERIES REGARDING COVID: DEVELOPING AND EVALUATING A TRANSFER LEARNING-BASED SOLUTION. BACKGROUND: TRIAGE OF TEXTUAL TELEMEDICAL QUERIES IS A SAFETY-CRITICAL TASK FOR MEDICAL SERVICE PROVIDERS WITH LIMITED REMOTE HEALTH RESOURCES. THE PRIORITIZATION OF PATIENT QUERIES CONTAINING MEDICALLY SEVERE TEXT IS NECESSARY TO OPTIMIZE RESOURCE USAGE AND PROVIDE CARE TO THOSE WITH TIME-SENSITIVE NEEDS. OBJECTIVE: WE AIM TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF TRANSFER LEARNING SOLUTIONS ON THE TASK OF TELEMEDICAL TRIAGE AND PROVIDE A THOROUGH ERROR ANALYSIS, IDENTIFYING TELEMEDICAL QUERIES THAT CHALLENGE STATE-OF-THE-ART NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) SYSTEMS. ADDITIONALLY, WE AIM TO PROVIDE A PUBLICLY AVAILABLE TELEMEDICAL QUERY DATA SET WITH LABELS FOR SEVERITY CLASSIFICATION FOR TELEMEDICAL TRIAGE OF RESPIRATORY ISSUES. METHODS: WE ANNOTATED 573 MEDICAL QUERIES FROM 3 ONLINE HEALTH PLATFORMS: HEALTHTAP, HEALTHCAREMAGIC, AND ICLINIQ. WE THEN EVALUATED 6 TRANSFER LEARNING SOLUTIONS UTILIZING VARIOUS TEXT-EMBEDDING STRATEGIES. SPECIFICALLY, WE FIRST ESTABLISHED A BASELINE USING A LEXICAL CLASSIFICATION MODEL WITH TERM FREQUENCY-INVERSE DOCUMENT FREQUENCY (TF-IDF) FEATURES. NEXT, WE INVESTIGATED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF GLOBAL VECTORS FOR TEXT REPRESENTATION (GLOVE), A PRETRAINED WORD-EMBEDDING METHOD. WE EVALUATED THE PERFORMANCE OF GLOVE EMBEDDINGS IN THE CONTEXT OF SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES (SVMS), BIDIRECTIONAL LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY (BI-LSTM) NETWORKS, AND HIERARCHICAL ATTENTION NETWORKS (HANS). FINALLY, WE EVALUATED THE PERFORMANCE OF CONTEXTUAL TEXT EMBEDDINGS USING TRANSFORMER-BASED ARCHITECTURES. SPECIFICALLY, WE EVALUATED BIDIRECTIONAL ENCODER REPRESENTATION FROM TRANSFORMERS (BERT), BIO+CLINICAL-BERT, AND SENTENCE-BERT (SBERT) ON THE TELEMEDICAL TRIAGE TASK. RESULTS: WE FOUND THAT A SIMPLE LEXICAL MODEL ACHIEVED A MEAN F1 SCORE OF 0.865 (SD 0.048) ON THE TELEMEDICAL TRIAGE TASK. GLOVE-BASED MODELS USING SVMS, HANS, AND BI-LSTMS ACHIEVED A 0.8-, 1.5-, AND 2.1-POINT INCREASE IN THE F1 SCORE, RESPECTIVELY. TRANSFORMER-BASED MODELS, SUCH AS BERT, BIO+CLINICAL-BERT, AND SBERT, ACHIEVED A MEAN F1 SCORE OF 0.914 (SD 0.034), 0.904 (SD 0.041), AND 0.917 (SD 0.037), RESPECTIVELY. THE HIGHEST-PERFORMING MODEL, SBERT, PROVIDED A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT COMPARED TO ALL GLOVE-BASED AND LEXICAL BASELINES. HOWEVER, NO STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE WAS FOUND WHEN COMPARING TRANSFORMER-BASED MODELS. FURTHERMORE, OUR ERROR ANALYSIS REVEALED HIGHLY CHALLENGING QUERY TYPES, INCLUDING THOSE WITH COMPLEX NEGATIONS, TEMPORAL RELATIONSHIPS, AND PATIENT INTENTS. CONCLUSIONS: WE SHOWED THAT STATE-OF-THE-ART TRANSFER LEARNING TECHNIQUES WORK WELL ON THE TELEMEDICAL TRIAGE TASK, PROVIDING SIGNIFICANT PERFORMANCE INCREASE OVER LEXICAL MODELS. ADDITIONALLY, WE RELEASED A PUBLIC TELEMEDICAL TRIAGE DATA SET USING LABELED QUESTIONS FROM ONLINE MEDICAL QUESTION-AND-ANSWER (Q&A) PLATFORMS. OUR ANALYSIS HIGHLIGHTS VARIOUS AVENUES FOR FUTURE WORKS THAT EXPLICITLY MODEL SUCH QUERY CHALLENGES.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
IDENTIFYING TWEETS OF PERSONAL HEALTH EXPERIENCE THROUGH WORD EMBEDDING AND LSTM NEURAL NETWORK. BACKGROUND: AS TWITTER HAS BECOME AN ACTIVE DATA SOURCE FOR HEALTH SURVEILLANCE RESEARCH, IT IS IMPORTANT THAT EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE METHODS ARE DEVELOPED TO IDENTIFY TWEETS RELATED TO PERSONAL HEALTH EXPERIENCE. CONVENTIONAL CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHMS RELY ON FEATURES ENGINEERED BY HUMAN DOMAIN EXPERTS, AND ENGINEERING SUCH FEATURES IS A CHALLENGING TASK AND REQUIRES MUCH HUMAN INTELLIGENCE. THE RESULTANT FEATURES MAY NOT BE OPTIMAL FOR THE CLASSIFICATION PROBLEM, AND CAN MAKE IT CHALLENGING FOR CONVENTIONAL CLASSIFIERS TO CORRECTLY PREDICT PERSONAL EXPERIENCE TWEETS (PETS) DUE TO THE VARIOUS WAYS TO EXPRESS AND/OR DESCRIBE PERSONAL EXPERIENCE IN TWEETS. IN THIS STUDY, WE DEVELOPED A METHOD THAT COMBINES WORD EMBEDDING AND LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY (LSTM) MODEL WITHOUT THE NEED TO ENGINEER ANY SPECIFIC FEATURES. THROUGH WORD EMBEDDING, TWEET TEXTS WERE REPRESENTED AS DENSE VECTORS WHICH IN TURN WERE FED TO THE LSTM NEURAL NETWORK AS SEQUENCES. RESULTS: STATISTICAL ANALYSES OF THE RESULTS OF 10-FOLD CROSS-VALIDATIONS OF OUR METHOD AND CONVENTIONAL METHODS INDICATE THAT THERE EXIST SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES (P < 0.01) IN PERFORMANCE MEASURES OF ACCURACY, PRECISION, RECALL, F1-SCORE, AND ROC/AUC, DEMONSTRATING THAT OUR APPROACH OUTPERFORMS THE CONVENTIONAL METHODS IN IDENTIFYING PETS. CONCLUSION: WE PRESENTED AN EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE METHOD OF IDENTIFYING HEALTH-RELATED PERSONAL EXPERIENCE TWEETS BY COMBINING WORD EMBEDDING AND AN LSTM NEURAL NETWORK. IT IS CONCEIVABLE THAT OUR METHOD CAN HELP ACCELERATE AND SCALE UP ANALYZING TEXTUAL DATA OF SOCIAL MEDIA FOR HEALTH SURVEILLANCE PURPOSES, BECAUSE OF NO NEED FOR THE LABORIOUS AND COSTLY PROCESS OF ENGINEERING FEATURES.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
IENHANCER-5STEP: IDENTIFYING ENHANCERS USING HIDDEN INFORMATION OF DNA SEQUENCES VIA CHOU'S 5-STEP RULE AND WORD EMBEDDING. AN ENHANCER IS A SHORT (50-1500BP) REGION OF DNA THAT PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN GENE EXPRESSION AND THE PRODUCTION OF RNA AND PROTEINS. GENETIC VARIATION IN ENHANCERS HAS BEEN LINKED TO MANY HUMAN DISEASES, SUCH AS CANCER, DISORDER OR INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE. DUE TO THE IMPORTANCE OF ENHANCERS IN GENOMICS, THE CLASSIFICATION OF ENHANCERS HAS BECOME A POPULAR AREA OF RESEARCH IN COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY. DESPITE THE FEW COMPUTATIONAL TOOLS EMPLOYED TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM, THEIR RESULTING PERFORMANCE STILL REQUIRES IMPROVEMENTS. IN THIS STUDY, WE TREAT ENHANCERS BY THE WORD EMBEDDINGS, INCLUDING SUB-WORD INFORMATION OF ITS BIOLOGICAL WORDS, WHICH THEN SERVE AS FEATURES TO BE FED INTO A SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE ALGORITHM TO CLASSIFY THEM. WE PRESENT IENHANCER-5STEP, A WEB SERVER CONTAINING TWO-LAYER CLASSIFIERS TO IDENTIFY ENHANCERS AND THEIR STRENGTH. WE ARE ABLE TO ATTAIN AN INDEPENDENT TEST ACCURACY OF 79% AND 63.5% IN THE TWO LAYERS, RESPECTIVELY. COMPARED TO CURRENT PREDICTORS ON THE SAME DATASET, OUR PROPOSED METHOD IS ABLE TO YIELD SUPERIOR PERFORMANCE AS COMPARED TO THE OTHER METHODS. MOREOVER, THIS STUDY PROVIDES A BASIS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH THAT CAN ENRICH THE FIELD OF APPLYING NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING TECHNIQUES IN BIOLOGICAL SEQUENCES. IENHANCER-5STEP IS FREELY ACCESSIBLE VIA HTTP://BIOLOGYDEEP.COM/FASTENC/.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
IENHANCER-GAN: A DEEP LEARNING FRAMEWORK IN COMBINATION WITH WORD EMBEDDING AND SEQUENCE GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NET TO IDENTIFY ENHANCERS AND THEIR STRENGTH. AS CRITICAL COMPONENTS OF DNA, ENHANCERS CAN EFFICIENTLY AND SPECIFICALLY MANIPULATE THE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL REGULATION OF GENE TRANSCRIPTION. MALFUNCTION OR DYSREGULATION OF ENHANCERS IS IMPLICATED IN A SLEW OF HUMAN PATHOLOGY. THEREFORE, IDENTIFYING ENHANCERS AND THEIR STRENGTH MAY PROVIDE INSIGHTS INTO THE MOLECULAR MECHANISMS OF GENE TRANSCRIPTION AND FACILITATE THE DISCOVERY OF CANDIDATE DRUG TARGETS. IN THIS PAPER, A NEW ENHANCER AND ITS STRENGTH PREDICTOR, IENHANCER-GAN, IS PROPOSED BASED ON A DEEP LEARNING FRAMEWORK IN COMBINATION WITH THE WORD EMBEDDING AND SEQUENCE GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NET (SEQ-GAN). CONSIDERING THE RELATIVELY SMALL TRAINING DATASET, THE SEQ-GAN IS DESIGNED TO GENERATE ARTIFICIAL SEQUENCES. GIVEN THAT EACH FUNCTIONAL ELEMENT IN DNA SEQUENCES IS ANALOGOUS TO A "WORD" IN LINGUISTICS, THE WORD SEGMENTATION METHODS ARE PROPOSED TO DIVIDE DNA SEQUENCES INTO "WORDS", AND THE SKIP-GRAM MODEL IS EMPLOYED TO TRANSFORM THE "WORDS" INTO DIGITAL VECTORS. IN VIEW OF THE POWERFUL ABILITY TO EXTRACT HIGH-LEVEL ABSTRACTION FEATURES, A CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (CNN) ARCHITECTURE IS CONSTRUCTED TO PERFORM THE IDENTIFICATION TASKS, AND THE WORD VECTORS OF DNA SEQUENCES ARE VERTICALLY CONCATENATED TO FORM THE EMBEDDING MATRICES AS THE INPUT OF THE CNN. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE SEQ-GAN TO EXPAND THE TRAINING DATASET, THE POSSIBILITY OF APPLYING WORD SEGMENTATION METHODS TO EXTRACT "WORDS" FROM DNA SEQUENCES, THE FEASIBILITY OF IMPLEMENTING THE SKIP-GRAM MODEL TO ENCODE DNA SEQUENCES, AND THE POWERFUL PREDICTION ABILITY OF THE CNN. COMPARED WITH OTHER STATE-OF-THE-ART METHODS ON THE TRAINING DATASET AND INDEPENDENT TEST DATASET, THE PROPOSED METHOD ACHIEVES A SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED OVERALL PERFORMANCE. IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT THE PROPOSED METHOD HAS A CERTAIN PROMOTION EFFECT ON ENHANCER RELATED FIELDS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
IMAGE CAPTIONING WITH END-TO-END ATTRIBUTE DETECTION AND SUBSEQUENT ATTRIBUTES PREDICTION. SEMANTIC ATTENTION HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE IN IMPROVING THE PERFORMANCE OF IMAGE CAPTIONING. THE CORE OF SEMANTIC ATTENTION BASED METHODS IS TO DRIVE THE MODEL TO ATTEND TO SEMANTICALLY IMPORTANT WORDS, OR ATTRIBUTES. IN PREVIOUS WORKS, THE ATTRIBUTE DETECTOR AND THE CAPTIONING NETWORK ARE USUALLY INDEPENDENT, LEADING TO THE INSUFFICIENT USAGE OF THE SEMANTIC INFORMATION. ALSO, ALL THE DETECTED ATTRIBUTES, NO MATTER WHETHER THEY ARE APPROPRIATE FOR THE LINGUISTIC CONTEXT AT THE CURRENT STEP, ARE ATTENDED TO THROUGH THE WHOLE CAPTION GENERATION PROCESS. THIS MAY SOMETIMES DISRUPT THE CAPTIONING MODEL TO ATTEND TO INCORRECT VISUAL CONCEPTS. TO SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS, WE INTRODUCE TWO END-TO-END TRAINABLE MODULES TO CLOSELY COUPLE ATTRIBUTE DETECTION WITH IMAGE CAPTIONING AS WELL AS PROMPT THE EFFECTIVE USES OF ATTRIBUTES BY PREDICTING APPROPRIATE ATTRIBUTES AT EACH TIME STEP. THE MULTIMODAL ATTRIBUTE DETECTOR (MAD) MODULE IMPROVES THE ATTRIBUTE DETECTION ACCURACY BY USING NOT ONLY THE IMAGE FEATURES BUT ALSO THE WORD EMBEDDING OF ATTRIBUTES ALREADY EXISTING IN MOST CAPTIONING MODELS. MAD MODELS THE SIMILARITY BETWEEN THE SEMANTICS OF ATTRIBUTES AND THE IMAGE OBJECT FEATURES TO FACILITATE ACCURATE DETECTION. THE SUBSEQUENT ATTRIBUTE PREDICTOR (SAP) MODULE DYNAMICALLY PREDICTS A CONCISE ATTRIBUTE SUBSET AT EACH TIME STEP TO MITIGATE THE DIVERSITY OF IMAGE ATTRIBUTES. COMPARED TO PREVIOUS ATTRIBUTE BASED METHODS, OUR APPROACH ENHANCES THE EXPLAINABILITY IN HOW THE ATTRIBUTES AFFECT THE GENERATED WORDS AND ACHIEVES A STATE-OF-THE-ART SINGLE MODEL PERFORMANCE OF 128.8 CIDER-D ON THE MSCOCO DATASET. EXTENSIVE EXPERIMENTS ON THE MSCOCO DATASET SHOW THAT OUR PROPOSAL ACTUALLY IMPROVES THE PERFORMANCES IN BOTH IMAGE CAPTIONING AND ATTRIBUTE DETECTION SIMULTANEOUSLY.

IMAGE RECOGNITION BY PREDICTED USER CLICK FEATURE WITH MULTIDOMAIN MULTITASK TRANSFER DEEP NETWORK. THE CLICK FEATURE OF AN IMAGE, DEFINED AS A USER CLICK COUNT VECTOR BASED ON CLICK DATA, HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO BE EFFECTIVE FOR REDUCING THE SEMANTIC GAP FOR IMAGE RECOGNITION. UNFORTUNATELY, MOST OF THE TRADITIONAL IMAGE RECOGNITION DATASETS DO NOT CONTAIN CLICK DATA. TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM, RESEARCHERS HAVE BEGUN TO DEVELOP A CLICK PREDICTION MODEL USING ASSISTANT DATASETS CONTAINING CLICK INFORMATION AND HAVE ADAPTED THIS PREDICTOR TO A COMMON CLICK-FREE DATASET FOR DIFFERENT TASKS. THIS METHOD CAN BE CUSTOMIZED TO OUR PROBLEM, BUT IT HAS TWO MAIN LIMITATIONS: 1) THE PREDICTED CLICK FEATURE OFTEN PERFORMS BADLY IN THE RECOGNITION TASK SINCE THE PREDICTION MODEL IS CONSTRUCTED INDEPENDENTLY OF THE SUBSEQUENT RECOGNITION PROBLEM AND 2) TRANSFERRING THE PREDICTOR FROM ONE DATASET TO ANOTHER IS CHALLENGING DUE TO THE LARGE CROSS-DOMAIN DIVERSITY. IN THIS PAPER, WE DEVISE A MULTITASK AND MULTIDOMAIN DEEP NETWORK WITH VARIED MODALS (MTMDD-VM) TO FORMULATE IMAGE RECOGNITION AND CLICK PREDICTION TASKS IN A UNIFIED FRAMEWORK. DATASETS WITH AND WITHOUT CLICK INFORMATION ARE INTEGRATED IN THE TRAINING. FURTHERMORE, A NONLINEAR WORD EMBEDDING WITH A POSITION-SENSITIVE LOSS FUNCTION IS DESIGNED TO DISCOVER THE VISUAL CLICK CORRELATION. WE EVALUATE THE PROPOSED METHOD ON THREE PUBLIC DOG BREED IMAGE DATASETS, AND WE UTILIZE THE CLICKTURE-DOG DATASET AS THE AUXILIARY DATASET THAT PROVIDES CLICK DATA. THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS SHOW THAT: 1) THE NONLINEAR WORD EMBEDDING AND POSITION-SENSITIVE LOSS FUNCTION LARGELY ENHANCE THE PREDICTED CLICK FEATURE IN THE RECOGNITION TASK, REALIZING A 32% IMPROVEMENT IN ACCURACY; 2) THE MULTITASK LEARNING FRAMEWORK IMPROVES ACCURACIES IN BOTH IMAGE RECOGNITION AND CLICK PREDICTION; AND 3) THE UNIFIED TRAINING USING THE COMBINED DATASET WITH AND WITHOUT CLICK DATA FURTHER IMPROVES THE PERFORMANCE. COMPARED WITH THE STATE-OF-THE-ART METHODS, THE PROPOSED APPROACH NOT ONLY PERFORMS MUCH BETTER IN ACCURACY BUT ALSO ACHIEVES GOOD SCALABILITY AND ONE-SHOT LEARNING ABILITY.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
IMPACT ANALYSIS OF KEYWORD EXTRACTION USING CONTEXTUAL WORD EMBEDDING. A DOCUMENT'S KEYWORDS PROVIDE HIGH-LEVEL DESCRIPTIONS OF THE CONTENT THAT SUMMARIZE THE DOCUMENT'S CENTRAL THEMES, CONCEPTS, IDEAS, OR ARGUMENTS. THESE DESCRIPTIVE PHRASES MAKE IT EASIER FOR ALGORITHMS TO FIND RELEVANT INFORMATION QUICKLY AND EFFICIENTLY. IT PLAYS A VITAL ROLE IN DOCUMENT PROCESSING, SUCH AS INDEXING, CLASSIFICATION, CLUSTERING, AND SUMMARIZATION. TRADITIONAL KEYWORD EXTRACTION APPROACHES RELY ON STATISTICAL DISTRIBUTIONS OF KEY TERMS IN A DOCUMENT FOR THE MOST PART. ACCORDING TO CONTEMPORARY TECHNOLOGICAL BREAKTHROUGHS, CONTEXTUAL INFORMATION IS CRITICAL IN DECIDING THE SEMANTICS OF THE WORK AT HAND. SIMILARLY, CONTEXT-BASED FEATURES MAY BE BENEFICIAL IN THE JOB OF KEYWORD EXTRACTION. FOR EXAMPLE, SIMPLY INDICATING THE PREVIOUS OR NEXT WORD OF THE PHRASE OF INTEREST MIGHT BE USED TO DESCRIBE THE CONTEXT OF A PHRASE. THIS RESEARCH PRESENTS SEVERAL EXPERIMENTS TO VALIDATE THAT CONTEXT-BASED KEY EXTRACTION IS SIGNIFICANT COMPARED TO TRADITIONAL METHODS. ADDITIONALLY, THE KEYBERT PROPOSED METHODOLOGY ALSO RESULTS IN IMPROVED RESULTS. THE PROPOSED WORK RELIES ON IDENTIFYING A GROUP OF IMPORTANT WORDS OR PHRASES FROM THE DOCUMENT'S CONTENT THAT CAN REFLECT THE AUTHORS' MAIN IDEAS, CONCEPTS, OR ARGUMENTS. IT ALSO USES CONTEXTUAL WORD EMBEDDING TO EXTRACT KEYWORDS. FINALLY, THE FINDINGS ARE COMPARED TO THOSE OBTAINED USING OLDER APPROACHES SUCH AS TEXT RANK, RAKE, GENSIM, YAKE, AND TF-IDF. THE JOURNALS OF UNIVERSAL COMPUTER (JUCS) DATASET WAS EMPLOYED IN OUR RESEARCH. ONLY DATA FROM ABSTRACTS WERE USED TO PRODUCE KEYWORDS FOR THE RESEARCH ARTICLE, AND THE KEYBERT MODEL OUTPERFORMED TRADITIONAL APPROACHES IN PRODUCING SIMILAR KEYWORDS TO THE AUTHORS' PROVIDED KEYWORDS. THE AVERAGE SIMILARITY OF OUR APPROACH WITH AUTHOR-ASSIGNED KEYWORDS IS 51%.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
IMPACT OF DE-IDENTIFICATION ON CLINICAL TEXT CLASSIFICATION USING TRADITIONAL AND DEEP LEARNING CLASSIFIERS. CLINICAL TEXT DE-IDENTIFICATION ENABLES COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH WHILE PROTECTING PATIENT PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY; HOWEVER, CONCERNS PERSIST ABOUT THE REDUCTION IN THE UTILITY OF THE DE-IDENTIFIED TEXT FOR INFORMATION EXTRACTION AND MACHINE LEARNING TASKS. IN THE CONTEXT OF A DEEP LEARNING EXPERIMENT TO DETECT ALTERED MENTAL STATUS IN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT PROVIDER NOTES, WE TESTED SEVERAL CLASSIFIERS ON CLINICAL NOTES IN THEIR ORIGINAL FORM AND ON THEIR AUTOMATICALLY DE-IDENTIFIED COUNTERPART. WE TESTED BOTH TRADITIONAL BAG-OF-WORDS BASED MACHINE LEARNING MODELS AS WELL AS WORD-EMBEDDING BASED DEEP LEARNING MODELS. WE EVALUATED THE MODELS ON 1,113 HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS NOTES. A TOTAL OF 1,795 PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION TOKENS WERE REPLACED IN THE DE-IDENTIFICATION PROCESS ACROSS ALL NOTES. THE DEEP LEARNING MODELS HAD THE BEST PERFORMANCE WITH ACCURACIES OF 95% ON BOTH ORIGINAL AND DE-IDENTIFIED NOTES. HOWEVER, THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE PERFORMANCE OF ANY OF THE MODELS ON THE ORIGINAL VS. THE DE-IDENTIFIED NOTES.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
IMPROVE WORD EMBEDDING USING BOTH WRITING AND PRONUNCIATION. TEXT REPRESENTATION CAN MAP TEXT INTO A VECTOR SPACE FOR SUBSEQUENT USE IN NUMERICAL CALCULATIONS AND PROCESSING TASKS. WORD EMBEDDING IS AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF TEXT REPRESENTATION. MOST EXISTING WORD EMBEDDING MODELS FOCUS ON WRITING AND UTILIZE CONTEXT, WEIGHT, DEPENDENCY, MORPHOLOGY, ETC., TO OPTIMIZE THE TRAINING. HOWEVER, FROM THE LINGUISTIC POINT OF VIEW, SPOKEN LANGUAGE IS A MORE DIRECT EXPRESSION OF SEMANTICS; WRITING HAS MEANING ONLY AS A RECORDING OF SPOKEN LANGUAGE. THEREFORE, THIS PAPER PROPOSES THE CONCEPT OF A PRONUNCIATION-ENHANCED WORD EMBEDDING MODEL (PWE) THAT INTEGRATES SPEECH INFORMATION INTO TRAINING TO FULLY APPLY THE ROLES OF BOTH SPEECH AND WRITING TO MEANING. THIS PAPER USES THE CHINESE LANGUAGE, ENGLISH LANGUAGE AND SPANISH LANGUAGE AS EXAMPLES AND PRESENTS SEVERAL MODELS THAT INTEGRATE WORD PRONUNCIATION CHARACTERISTICS INTO WORD EMBEDDING. WORD SIMILARITY AND TEXT CLASSIFICATION EXPERIMENTS SHOW THAT THE PWE OUTPERFORMS THE BASELINE MODEL THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE SPEECH INFORMATION. LANGUAGE IS A STOREHOUSE OF SOUND-IMAGES; THEREFORE, THE PWE CAN BE APPLIED TO MOST LANGUAGES.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
IMPROVING CLINICAL NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION IN CHINESE USING THE GRAPHICAL AND PHONETIC FEATURE. BACKGROUND: CLINICAL NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION IS TO FIND THE NAME OF DISEASES, BODY PARTS AND OTHER RELATED TERMS FROM THE GIVEN TEXT. BECAUSE CHINESE LANGUAGE IS QUITE DIFFERENT WITH ENGLISH LANGUAGE, THE MACHINE CANNOT SIMPLY GET THE GRAPHICAL AND PHONETIC INFORMATION FORM CHINESE CHARACTERS. THE METHOD FOR CHINESE SHOULD BE DIFFERENT FROM THAT FOR ENGLISH. CHINESE CHARACTERS PRESENT ABUNDANT INFORMATION WITH THE GRAPHICAL FEATURES, RECENT RESEARCH ON CHINESE WORD EMBEDDING TRIES TO USE GRAPHICAL INFORMATION AS SUBWORD. THIS PAPER USES BOTH GRAPHICAL AND PHONETIC FEATURES TO IMPROVE CHINESE CLINICAL NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION BASED ON THE PRESENCE OF PHONO-SEMANTIC CHARACTERS. METHODS: THIS PAPER PROPOSED THREE DIFFERENT EMBEDDING MODELS AND TESTED THEM ON THE ANNOTATED DATA. THE DATA HAVE BEEN DIVIDED INTO TWO SECTIONS FOR EXPLORING THE EFFECT OF THE PROPORTION OF PHONO-SEMANTIC CHARACTERS. RESULTS: THE MODEL USING PRIMARY RADICAL AND PINYIN CAN IMPROVE CLINICAL NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION IN CHINESE AND GET THE F-MEASURE OF 0.712. MORE PHONO-SEMANTIC CHARACTERS DOES NOT GIVE A BETTER RESULT. CONCLUSIONS: THE PAPER PROVES THAT THE USE OF THE COMBINATION OF GRAPHICAL AND PHONETIC FEATURES CAN IMPROVE THE CLINICAL NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION IN CHINESE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
IMPROVING CONSUMER UNDERSTANDING OF MEDICAL TEXT: DEVELOPMENT AND VALIDATION OF A NEW SUBSIMPLIFY ALGORITHM TO AUTOMATICALLY GENERATE TERM EXPLANATIONS IN ENGLISH AND SPANISH. BACKGROUND: WHILE HEALTH LITERACY IS IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO MAINTAIN GOOD HEALTH AND MANAGE DISEASES, MEDICAL EDUCATIONAL TEXTS ARE OFTEN WRITTEN BEYOND THE READING LEVEL OF THE AVERAGE INDIVIDUAL. TO MITIGATE THIS DISCONNECT, TEXT SIMPLIFICATION RESEARCH PROVIDES METHODS TO INCREASE READABILITY AND, THEREFORE, COMPREHENSION. ONE METHOD OF TEXT SIMPLIFICATION IS TO ISOLATE PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT TERMS WITHIN A DOCUMENT AND REPLACE THEM WITH EASIER SYNONYMS (LEXICAL SIMPLIFICATION) OR AN EXPLANATION IN PLAIN LANGUAGE (SEMANTIC SIMPLIFICATION). UNFORTUNATELY, EXISTING DICTIONARIES ARE SELDOM COMPLETE, AND CONSEQUENTLY, RESOURCES FOR MANY DIFFICULT TERMS ARE UNAVAILABLE. THIS IS THE CASE FOR ENGLISH AND SPANISH RESOURCES. OBJECTIVE: OUR OBJECTIVE WAS TO AUTOMATICALLY GENERATE EXPLANATIONS FOR DIFFICULT TERMS IN BOTH ENGLISH AND SPANISH WHEN THEY ARE NOT COVERED BY EXISTING RESOURCES. THE SYSTEM WE PRESENT COMBINES EXISTING RESOURCES FOR EXPLANATION GENERATION USING A NOVEL ALGORITHM (SUBSIMPLIFY) TO CREATE ADDITIONAL EXPLANATIONS. METHODS: SUBSIMPLIFY USES WORD-LEVEL PARSING TECHNIQUES AND SPECIALIZED MEDICAL AFFIX DICTIONARIES TO IDENTIFY THE MORPHOLOGICAL UNITS OF A TERM AND THEN SOURCE THEIR DEFINITIONS. WHILE THE UNDERLYING RESOURCES ARE DIFFERENT, SUBSIMPLIFY APPLIES THE SAME PRINCIPLES IN BOTH LANGUAGES. TO EVALUATE OUR APPROACH, WE USED TERM FAMILIARITY TO IDENTIFY DIFFICULT TERMS IN ENGLISH AND SPANISH AND THEN GENERATED EXPLANATIONS FOR THEM. FOR EACH LANGUAGE, WE EXTRACTED 400 DIFFICULT TERMS FROM TWO DIFFERENT ARTICLE TYPES (GENERAL AND MEDICAL TOPICS) BALANCED FOR FREQUENCY. FOR ENGLISH TERMS, WE COMPARED SUBSIMPLIFY'S EXPLANATION WITH THE EXPLANATIONS FROM THE CONSUMER HEALTH VOCABULARY, WORDNET SYNONYMS AND SUMMARIES, AS WELL AS WORD EMBEDDING VECTOR (WEV) SYNONYMS. FOR SPANISH TERMS, WE COMPARED THE EXPLANATION TO WORDNET SUMMARIES AND WEV EMBEDDING SYNONYMS. WE EVALUATED QUALITY, COVERAGE, AND USEFULNESS FOR THE SIMPLIFICATION PROVIDED FOR EACH TERM. QUALITY IS THE AVERAGE SCORE FROM TWO SUBJECT EXPERTS ON A 1-4 LIKERT SCALE (TWO PER LANGUAGE) FOR THE SYNONYMS OR EXPLANATIONS PROVIDED BY THE SOURCE. COVERAGE IS THE NUMBER OF TERMS FOR WHICH A SOURCE COULD PROVIDE AN EXPLANATION. USEFULNESS IS THE SAME EXPERT SCORE, HOWEVER, WITH A 0 ASSIGNED WHEN NO EXPLANATIONS OR SYNONYMS WERE AVAILABLE FOR A TERM. RESULTS: SUBSIMPLIFY RESULTED IN QUALITY SCORES OF 1.64 FOR ENGLISH (P<.001) AND 1.49 FOR SPANISH (P<.001), WHICH WERE LOWER THAN THOSE OF EXISTING RESOURCES (CONSUMER HEALTH VOCABULARY [CHV]=2.81). HOWEVER, IN COVERAGE, SUBSIMPLIFY OUTPERFORMS ALL EXISTING WRITTEN RESOURCES, INCREASING THE COVERAGE FROM 53.0% TO 80.5% IN ENGLISH AND FROM 20.8% TO 90.8% IN SPANISH (P<.001). THIS RESULT MEANS THAT THE USEFULNESS SCORE OF SUBSIMPLIFY (1.32; P<.001) IS GREATER THAN THAT OF MOST EXISTING RESOURCES (EG, CHV=0.169). CONCLUSIONS: OUR APPROACH IS INTENDED AS AN ADDITIONAL RESOURCE TO EXISTING, MANUALLY CREATED RESOURCES. IT GREATLY INCREASES THE NUMBER OF DIFFICULT TERMS FOR WHICH AN EASIER ALTERNATIVE CAN BE MADE AVAILABLE, RESULTING IN GREATER ACTUAL USEFULNESS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
IMPROVING MEDICAL Q&A MATCHING BY AUGMENTING DUAL-CHANNEL ATTENTION WITH GLOBAL SIMILARITY. THE EMERGENCE OF ONLINE MEDICAL QUESTION-ANSWER COMMUNITIES HAS HELPED TO BALANCE THE SUPPLY OF MEDICAL RESOURCES. HOWEVER, THE DRAMATIC INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS CONSULTING ONLINE RESOURCES HAS RESULTED IN A LARGE NUMBER OF REPETITIVE MEDICAL QUESTIONS, SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCING THE EFFICIENCY OF DOCTORS IN ANSWERING THESE QUESTIONS. TO IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY OF ONLINE CONSULTATIONS, A LARGE NUMBER OF DEEP LEARNING METHODS HAVE BEEN USED FOR MEDICAL QUESTION-ANSWER MATCHING TASKS. MEDICAL QUESTION-ANSWER MATCHING INVOLVES IDENTIFYING THE BEST ANSWER TO A GIVEN QUESTION FROM A SET OF CANDIDATE ANSWERS. PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE FOCUSED ON REPRESENTATION-BASED AND INTERACTION-BASED QUESTION-ANSWER PAIRS, WITH LITTLE ATTENTION PAID TO THE EFFECT OF NOISE WORDS ON MATCHING. MOREOVER, ONLY LOCAL-LEVEL INFORMATION WAS USED FOR SIMILARITY MODELING, IGNORING THE IMPORTANCE OF GLOBAL-LEVEL INFORMATION. IN THIS PAPER, WE PROPOSE A DUAL-CHANNEL ATTENTION WITH GLOBAL SIMILARITY (DCAG) FRAMEWORK TO ADDRESS THE ABOVE ISSUES IN QUESTION-ANSWER MATCHING. THE INTRODUCTION OF A SELF-ATTENTION MECHANISM ASSIGNS A DIFFERENT WEIGHT TO EACH WORD IN QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS, REDUCING THE NOISE OF "USELESS WORDS" IN SENTENCES. AFTER THE TEXT REPRESENTATIONS WERE OBTAINED THROUGH THE DUAL-CHANNEL ATTENTION MODEL, A GATING MECHANISM WAS INTRODUCED FOR GLOBAL SIMILARITY MODELING. THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS ON THE CMEDQA V1.0 DATASET SHOW THAT OUR FRAMEWORK SIGNIFICANTLY OUTPERFORMED EXISTING STATE-OF-THE-ART MODELS, ESPECIALLY THOSE USING PRETRAINED BERT MODELS FOR WORD EMBEDDING, IMPROVING THE TOP-1 ACCURACY TO 75.6%.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
IMPROVING PROTEIN SUCCINYLATION SITES PREDICTION USING EMBEDDINGS FROM PROTEIN LANGUAGE MODEL. PROTEIN SUCCINYLATION IS AN IMPORTANT POST-TRANSLATIONAL MODIFICATION (PTM) RESPONSIBLE FOR MANY VITAL METABOLIC ACTIVITIES IN CELLS, INCLUDING CELLULAR RESPIRATION, REGULATION, AND REPAIR. HERE, WE PRESENT A NOVEL APPROACH THAT COMBINES FEATURES FROM SUPERVISED WORD EMBEDDING WITH EMBEDDING FROM A PROTEIN LANGUAGE MODEL CALLED PROTT5-XL-UNIREF50 (HEREAFTER TERMED, PROTT5) IN A DEEP LEARNING FRAMEWORK TO PREDICT PROTEIN SUCCINYLATION SITES. TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, THIS IS ONE OF THE FIRST ATTEMPTS TO EMPLOY EMBEDDING FROM A PRE-TRAINED PROTEIN LANGUAGE MODEL TO PREDICT PROTEIN SUCCINYLATION SITES. THE PROPOSED MODEL, DUBBED LMSUCCSITE, ACHIEVES STATE-OF-THE-ART RESULTS COMPARED TO EXISTING METHODS, WITH PERFORMANCE SCORES OF 0.36, 0.79, 0.79 FOR MCC, SENSITIVITY, AND SPECIFICITY, RESPECTIVELY. LMSUCCSITE IS LIKELY TO SERVE AS A VALUABLE RESOURCE FOR EXPLORATION OF SUCCINYLATION AND ITS ROLE IN CELLULAR PHYSIOLOGY AND DISEASE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
IMPROVING SENTIMENT ANALYSIS FOR SOCIAL MEDIA APPLICATIONS USING AN ENSEMBLE DEEP LEARNING LANGUAGE MODEL. AS DATA GROW RAPIDLY ON SOCIAL MEDIA BY USERS' CONTRIBUTIONS, SPECIALLY WITH THE RECENT CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC, THE NEED TO ACQUIRE KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR BEHAVIORS IS IN HIGH DEMAND. THE OPINIONS BEHIND POSTS ON THE PANDEMIC ARE THE SCOPE OF THE TESTED DATASET IN THIS STUDY. FINDING THE MOST SUITABLE CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHMS FOR THIS KIND OF DATA IS CHALLENGING. WITHIN THIS CONTEXT, MODELS OF DEEP LEARNING FOR SENTIMENT ANALYSIS CAN INTRODUCE DETAILED REPRESENTATION CAPABILITIES AND ENHANCED PERFORMANCE COMPARED TO EXISTING FEATURE-BASED TECHNIQUES. IN THIS PAPER, WE FOCUS ON ENHANCING THE PERFORMANCE OF SENTIMENT CLASSIFICATION USING A CUSTOMIZED DEEP LEARNING MODEL WITH AN ADVANCED WORD EMBEDDING TECHNIQUE AND CREATE A LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY (LSTM) NETWORK. FURTHERMORE, WE PROPOSE AN ENSEMBLE MODEL THAT COMBINES OUR BASELINE CLASSIFIER WITH OTHER STATE-OF-THE-ART CLASSIFIERS USED FOR SENTIMENT ANALYSIS. THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THIS PAPER ARE TWOFOLD. (1) WE ESTABLISH A ROBUST FRAMEWORK BASED ON WORD EMBEDDING AND AN LSTM NETWORK THAT LEARNS THE CONTEXTUAL RELATIONS AMONG WORDS AND UNDERSTANDS UNSEEN OR RARE WORDS IN RELATIVELY EMERGING SITUATIONS SUCH AS THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC BY RECOGNIZING SUFFIXES AND PREFIXES FROM TRAINING DATA. (2) WE CAPTURE AND UTILIZE THE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN STATE-OF-THE-ART METHODS BY PROPOSING A HYBRID ENSEMBLE MODEL FOR SENTIMENT ANALYSIS. WE CONDUCT SEVERAL EXPERIMENTS USING OUR OWN TWITTER CORONAVIRUS HASHTAG DATASET AS WELL AS PUBLIC REVIEW DATASETS FROM AMAZON AND YELP. FOR CONCLUDING RESULTS, A STATISTICAL STUDY IS CARRIED OUT INDICATING THAT THE PERFORMANCE OF THESE PROPOSED MODELS SURPASSES OTHER MODELS IN TERMS OF CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
IMPROVING THE CONTES METHOD FOR NORMALIZING BIOMEDICAL TEXT ENTITIES WITH CONCEPTS FROM AN ONTOLOGY WITH (ALMOST) NO TRAINING DATA. ENTITY NORMALIZATION, OR ENTITY LINKING IN THE GENERAL DOMAIN, IS AN INFORMATION EXTRACTION TASK THAT AIMS TO ANNOTATE/BIND MULTIPLE WORDS/EXPRESSIONS IN RAW TEXT WITH SEMANTIC REFERENCES, SUCH AS CONCEPTS OF AN ONTOLOGY. AN ONTOLOGY CONSISTS MINIMALLY OF A FORMALLY ORGANIZED VOCABULARY OR HIERARCHY OF TERMS, WHICH CAPTURES KNOWLEDGE OF A DOMAIN. PRESENTLY, MACHINE-LEARNING METHODS, OFTEN COUPLED WITH DISTRIBUTIONAL REPRESENTATIONS, ACHIEVE GOOD PERFORMANCE. HOWEVER, THESE REQUIRE LARGE TRAINING DATASETS, WHICH ARE NOT ALWAYS AVAILABLE, ESPECIALLY FOR TASKS IN SPECIALIZED DOMAINS. CONTES (CONCEPT-TERM SYSTEM) IS A SUPERVISED METHOD THAT ADDRESSES ENTITY NORMALIZATION WITH ONTOLOGY CONCEPTS USING SMALL TRAINING DATASETS. CONTES HAS SOME LIMITATIONS, SUCH AS IT DOES NOT SCALE WELL WITH VERY LARGE ONTOLOGIES, IT TENDS TO OVERGENERALIZE PREDICTIONS, AND IT LACKS VALID REPRESENTATIONS FOR THE OUT-OF-VOCABULARY WORDS. HERE, WE PROPOSE TO ASSESS DIFFERENT METHODS TO REDUCE THE DIMENSIONALITY IN THE REPRESENTATION OF THE ONTOLOGY. WE ALSO PROPOSE TO CALIBRATE PARAMETERS IN ORDER TO MAKE THE PREDICTIONS MORE ACCURATE, AND TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OF OUT-OF-VOCABULARY WORDS, WITH A SPECIFIC METHOD.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
IMPROVING THE NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION OF CHINESE ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS BY COMBINING DOMAIN DICTIONARY AND RULES. ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS ARE AN INTEGRAL PART OF MEDICAL TEXTS. ENTITY RECOGNITION OF ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS HAS TRIGGERED MANY STUDIES THAT PROPOSE MANY ENTITY EXTRACTION METHODS. IN THIS PAPER, AN ENTITY EXTRACTION MODEL IS PROPOSED TO EXTRACT ENTITIES FROM CHINESE ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS (CEMR). IN THE INPUT LAYER OF THE MODEL, WE USE WORD EMBEDDING AND DICTIONARY FEATURES EMBEDDING AS INPUT VECTORS, WHERE WORD EMBEDDING CONSISTS OF A CHARACTER REPRESENTATION AND A WORD REPRESENTATION. THEN, THE INPUT VECTORS ARE FED TO THE BIDIRECTIONAL LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY TO CAPTURE CONTEXTUAL FEATURES. FINALLY, A CONDITIONAL RANDOM FIELD IS EMPLOYED TO CAPTURE DEPENDENCIES BETWEEN NEIGHBORING TAGS. WE PERFORMED EXPERIMENTS ON BODY CLASSIFICATION TASK, AND THE F1 VALUES REACHED 90.65%. WE ALSO PERFORMED EXPERIMENTS ON ANATOMIC REGION RECOGNITION TASK, AND THE F1 VALUES REACHED 93.89%. ON BOTH TASKS, OUR MODEL HAD HIGHER PERFORMANCE THAN STATE-OF-THE-ART MODELS, SUCH AS BI-LSTM-CRF, BI-LSTM-ATTENTION, AND VOTE. THROUGH EXPERIMENTS, OUR MODEL HAS A GOOD EFFECT WHEN DEALING WITH SMALL FREQUENCY ENTITIES AND UNKNOWN ENTITIES; WITH A SMALL TRAINING DATASET, OUR METHOD SHOWED 2-4% IMPROVEMENT ON F1 VALUE COMPARED TO THE BASIC BI-LSTM-CRF MODELS. ADDITIONALLY, ON ANATOMIC REGION RECOGNITION TASK, BESIDES USING OUR PROPOSED ENTITY EXTRACTION MODEL, 12 RULES WE DESIGNED AND DOMAIN DICTIONARY WERE ADOPTED. THEN, IN THIS TASK, THE WEIGHTED F1 VALUE OF THE THREE SPECIFIC ENTITIES EXTRACTION REACHED 84.36%.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
IMPROVING WORD EMBEDDINGS IN PORTUGUESE: INCREASING ACCURACY WHILE REDUCING THE SIZE OF THE CORPUS. THE SUBJECTIVENESS OF MULTIMEDIA CONTENT DESCRIPTION HAS A STRONG NEGATIVE IMPACT ON TAG-BASED INFORMATION RETRIEVAL. IN OUR WORK, WE PROPOSE ENHANCING AVAILABLE DESCRIPTIONS BY ADDING SEMANTICALLY RELATED TAGS. TO COPE WITH THIS OBJECTIVE, WE USE A WORD EMBEDDING TECHNIQUE BASED ON THE WORD2VEC NEURAL NETWORK PARAMETERIZED AND TRAINED USING A NEW DATASET BUILT FROM ONLINE NEWSPAPERS. A LARGE NUMBER OF NEWS STORIES WAS SCRAPED AND PRE-PROCESSED TO BUILD A NEW DATASET. OUR TARGET LANGUAGE IS PORTUGUESE, ONE OF THE MOST SPOKEN LANGUAGES WORLDWIDE. THE RESULTS ACHIEVED SIGNIFICANTLY OUTPERFORM SIMILAR EXISTING SOLUTIONS DEVELOPED IN THE SCOPE OF DIFFERENT LANGUAGES, INCLUDING PORTUGUESE. CONTRIBUTIONS INCLUDE ALSO AN ONLINE APPLICATION AND API AVAILABLE FOR EXTERNAL USE. ALTHOUGH THE PRESENTED WORK HAS BEEN DESIGNED TO ENHANCE MULTIMEDIA CONTENT ANNOTATION, IT CAN BE USED IN SEVERAL OTHER APPLICATION AREAS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
INCORPORATING DEEP LEARNING WITH WORD EMBEDDING TO IDENTIFY PLANT UBIQUITYLATION SITES. PROTEIN UBIQUITYLATION IS AN IMPORTANT POSTTRANSLATIONAL MODIFICATION (PTM), WHICH IS INVOLVED IN DIVERSE BIOLOGICAL PROCESSES AND PLAYS AN ESSENTIAL ROLE IN THE REGULATION OF PHYSIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS AND DISEASES. THE PROTEIN LYSINE MODIFICATIONS DATABASE (PLMD) HAS ACCUMULATED ABUNDANT UBIQUITYLATED PROTEINS WITH THEIR SUBSTRATE SITES FOR MORE THAN 20 KINDS OF SPECIES. NUMEROUS WORKS HAVE CONSEQUENTLY DEVELOPED A VARIETY OF UBIQUITYLATION SITE PREDICTION TOOLS ACROSS ALL SPECIES, MAINLY RELYING ON THE PREDEFINED SEQUENCE FEATURES AND MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS. HOWEVER, THE DIFFERENCE IN UBIQUITYLATED PATTERNS BETWEEN THESE SPECIES STAYS UNCLEAR. IN THIS WORK, THE SEQUENCE-BASED CHARACTERIZATION OF UBIQUITYLATED SUBSTRATE SITES HAS REVEALED REMARKABLE DIFFERENCES AMONG PLANTS, ANIMALS, AND FUNGI. THEN AN IMPROVED WORD-EMBEDDING SCHEME BASED ON THE TRANSFER LEARNING STRATEGY WAS INCORPORATED WITH THE MULTILAYER CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (CNN) FOR IDENTIFYING PROTEIN UBIQUITYLATION SITES. FOR THE PREDICTION OF PLANT UBIQUITYLATION SITES, THE PROPOSED DEEP LEARNING SCHEME COULD OUTPERFORM THE MACHINE LEARNING-BASED METHODS, WITH THE ACCURACY OF 75.6%, PRECISION OF 73.3%, RECALL OF 76.7%, F-SCORE OF 0.7493, AND 0.82 AUC ON THE INDEPENDENT TESTING SET. ALTHOUGH THE UBIQUITYLATED SPECIFICITY OF SUBSTRATE SITES IS COMPLICATED, THIS WORK HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT THE APPLICATION OF THE WORD-EMBEDDING METHOD CAN ENABLE THE EXTRACTION OF INFORMATIVE FEATURES AND HELP THE IDENTIFICATION OF UBIQUITYLATED SITES. TO ACCELERATE THE INVESTIGATION OF PROTEIN UBIQUITYLATION, THE DATA SETS AND SOURCE CODE USED IN THIS STUDY ARE FREELY AVAILABLE AT HTTPS://GITHUB.COM/WANG-HONG-FEI/DL-PLANT-UBSITES-PREDICTION.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
INTEGRATING TOPIC MODELING AND WORD EMBEDDING TO CHARACTERIZE VIOLENT DEATHS. SIGNIFICANCEWE INTRODUCE AN APPROACH TO IDENTIFY LATENT TOPICS IN LARGE-SCALE TEXT DATA. OUR APPROACH INTEGRATES TWO PROMINENT METHODS OF COMPUTATIONAL TEXT ANALYSIS: TOPIC MODELING AND WORD EMBEDDING. WE APPLY OUR APPROACH TO WRITTEN NARRATIVES OF VIOLENT DEATH (E.G., SUICIDES AND HOMICIDES) IN THE NATIONAL VIOLENT DEATH REPORTING SYSTEM (NVDRS). MANY OF OUR TOPICS REVEAL ASPECTS OF VIOLENT DEATH NOT CAPTURED IN EXISTING CLASSIFICATION SCHEMES. WE ALSO EXTRACT GENDER BIAS IN THE TOPICS THEMSELVES (E.G., A TOPIC ABOUT LONG GUNS IS PARTICULARLY MASCULINE). OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST NEW LINES OF RESEARCH THAT COULD CONTRIBUTE TO REDUCING SUICIDES OR HOMICIDES. OUR METHODS ARE BROADLY APPLICABLE TO TEXT DATA AND CAN UNLOCK SIMILAR INFORMATION IN OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE DATABASES.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
INTEGRATION OF A DEEP LEARNING CLASSIFIER WITH A RANDOM FOREST APPROACH FOR PREDICTING MALONYLATION SITES. AS A NEWLY-IDENTIFIED PROTEIN POST-TRANSLATIONAL MODIFICATION, MALONYLATION IS INVOLVED IN A VARIETY OF BIOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS. RECOGNIZING MALONYLATION SITES IN SUBSTRATES REPRESENTS AN INITIAL BUT CRUCIAL STEP IN ELUCIDATING THE MOLECULAR MECHANISMS UNDERLYING PROTEIN MALONYLATION. IN THIS STUDY, WE CONSTRUCTED A DEEP LEARNING (DL) NETWORK CLASSIFIER BASED ON LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY (LSTM) WITH WORD EMBEDDING (LSTMWE) FOR THE PREDICTION OF MAMMALIAN MALONYLATION SITES. LSTMWE PERFORMS BETTER THAN TRADITIONAL CLASSIFIERS DEVELOPED WITH COMMON PRE-DEFINED FEATURE ENCODINGS OR A DL CLASSIFIER BASED ON LSTM WITH A ONE-HOT VECTOR. THE PERFORMANCE OF LSTMWE IS SENSITIVE TO THE SIZE OF THE TRAINING SET, BUT THIS LIMITATION CAN BE OVERCOME BY INTEGRATION WITH A TRADITIONAL MACHINE LEARNING (ML) CLASSIFIER. ACCORDINGLY, AN INTEGRATED APPROACH CALLED LEMP WAS DEVELOPED, WHICH INCLUDES LSTMWE AND THE RANDOM FOREST CLASSIFIER WITH A NOVEL ENCODING OF ENHANCED AMINO ACID CONTENT. LEMP PERFORMS NOT ONLY BETTER THAN THE INDIVIDUAL CLASSIFIERS BUT ALSO SUPERIOR TO THE CURRENTLY-AVAILABLE MALONYLATION PREDICTORS. ADDITIONALLY, IT DEMONSTRATES A PROMISING PERFORMANCE WITH A LOW FALSE POSITIVE RATE, WHICH IS HIGHLY USEFUL IN THE PREDICTION APPLICATION. OVERALL, LEMP IS A USEFUL TOOL FOR EASILY IDENTIFYING MALONYLATION SITES WITH HIGH CONFIDENCE. LEMP IS AVAILABLE AT HTTP://WWW.BIOINFOGO.ORG/LEMP.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
INTELLIGENCE CUSTOMS DECLARATION FOR CROSS-BORDER E-COMMERCE BASED ON THE MULTI-MODAL MODEL AND THE OPTIMAL WINDOW MECHANISM. THIS PAPER AIMS TO STUDY THE INTELLIGENT CUSTOMS DECLARATION OF CROSS-BORDER E-COMMERCE COMMODITIES FROM ALGORITHM DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION. THE DIFFICULTY OF THIS ISSUE IS THE RECOGNITION OF COMMODITY NAMES, MATERIALS, AND PROCESSING PROCESSES. BECAUSE THE PROCESS OF RECOGNIZING THESE THREE KINDS OF COMMODITY INFORMATION IS SIMILAR, THIS PAPER CHOOSES TO IDENTIFY THE COMMODITY NAME AS THE EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH OBJECT. THE ALGORITHM IN THIS PAPER IS BASED ON THE PREMISE OF PRE-CLUSTERING, USING AN OPTIMAL WINDOW MECHANISM TO OBTAIN THE BEST WORD EMBEDDING VECTOR REPRESENTATION. THE VISION TRANSFORMER MODEL EXTRACTS IMAGE FEATURES INSTEAD OF TRADITIONAL CNN MODELS, AND THEN TEXT FEATURES ARE FUSED WITH IMAGE FEATURES TO GENERATE A MULTI-MODAL SEMANTICALLY FEATURE VECTOR. FINALLY, A DEEP FOREST CLASSIFIER REPLACES THE CONVENTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK CLASSIFIERS TO COMPLETE THE COMMODITY NAME RECOGNITION TASK. THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS SHOW THAT, FOR MORE THAN 600 DIFFERENT COMMODITIES ON THE 120,000 DATA RECORDS, THE PRECISION IS 0.85, THE RECALL IS 0.87, AND THE F 1 _SCORE IS 0.86. SO, OUR ALGORITHM CAN EFFECTIVELY AND ACCURATELY RECOGNIZE E-COMMERCE COMMODITY NAMES AND PROVIDE A NEW PERSPECTIVE ON THE RESEARCH OF E-COMMERCE INTELLIGENCE DECLARATIONS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
INTELLIGENT DIAGNOSIS WITH CHINESE ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS BASED ON CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS. BACKGROUND: BENEFITING FROM BIG DATA, POWERFUL COMPUTATION AND NEW ALGORITHMIC TECHNIQUES, WE HAVE BEEN WITNESSING THE RENAISSANCE OF DEEP LEARNING, PARTICULARLY THE COMBINATION OF NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) AND DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS. THE ADVENT OF ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS (EMRS) HAS NOT ONLY CHANGED THE FORMAT OF MEDICAL RECORDS BUT ALSO HELPED USERS TO OBTAIN INFORMATION FASTER. HOWEVER, THERE ARE MANY CHALLENGES REGARDING RESEARCHING DIRECTLY USING CHINESE EMRS, SUCH AS LOW QUALITY, HUGE QUANTITY, IMBALANCE, SEMI-STRUCTURE AND NON-STRUCTURE, PARTICULARLY THE HIGH DENSITY OF THE CHINESE LANGUAGE COMPARED WITH ENGLISH. THEREFORE, EFFECTIVE WORD SEGMENTATION, WORD REPRESENTATION AND MODEL ARCHITECTURE ARE THE CORE TECHNOLOGIES IN THE LITERATURE ON CHINESE EMRS. RESULTS: IN THIS PAPER, WE PROPOSE A DEEP LEARNING FRAMEWORK TO STUDY INTELLIGENT DIAGNOSIS USING CHINESE EMR DATA, WHICH INCORPORATES A CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (CNN) INTO AN EMR CLASSIFICATION APPLICATION. THE NOVELTY OF THIS PAPER IS REFLECTED IN THE FOLLOWING: (1) WE CONSTRUCT A PEDIATRIC MEDICAL DICTIONARY BASED ON CHINESE EMRS. (2) WORD2VEC ADOPTED IN WORD EMBEDDING IS USED TO ACHIEVE THE SEMANTIC DESCRIPTION OF THE CONTENT OF CHINESE EMRS. (3) A FINE-TUNING CNN MODEL IS CONSTRUCTED TO FEED THE PEDIATRIC DIAGNOSIS WITH CHINESE EMR DATA. OUR RESULTS ON REAL-WORLD PEDIATRIC CHINESE EMRS DEMONSTRATE THAT THE AVERAGE ACCURACY AND F1-SCORE OF THE CNN MODELS ARE UP TO 81%, WHICH INDICATES THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE CNN MODEL FOR THE CLASSIFICATION OF EMRS. PARTICULARLY, A FINE-TUNING ONE-LAYER CNN PERFORMS BEST AMONG ALL CNNS, RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORK (RNN) (LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY, GATED RECURRENT UNIT) AND CNN-RNN MODELS, AND THE AVERAGE ACCURACY AND F1-SCORE ARE BOTH UP TO 83%. CONCLUSION: THE CNN FRAMEWORK THAT INCLUDES WORD SEGMENTATION, WORD EMBEDDING AND MODEL TRAINING CAN SERVE AS AN INTELLIGENT AUXILIARY DIAGNOSIS TOOL FOR PEDIATRICIANS. PARTICULARLY, A FINE-TUNING ONE-LAYER CNN PERFORMS WELL, WHICH INDICATES THAT WORD ORDER DOES NOT APPEAR TO HAVE A USEFUL EFFECT ON OUR CHINESE EMRS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS (ITS): A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW USING A NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) APPROACH. INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS (ITS) IS NOT A NEW CONCEPT. NOTABLY, ITS HAS BEEN CITED IN VARIOUS JOURNAL ARTICLES AND PROCEEDINGS PAPERS AROUND THE WORLD, AND IT HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY POPULAR. ADDITIONALLY, ITS INVOLVES MULTIDISCIPLINARY SCIENCE. THE GROWING NUMBER OF JOURNAL ARTICLES MAKES ITS REVIEWS COMPLICATED, AND RESEARCH GAPS CAN BE DIFFICULT TO IDENTIFY. THE EXISTING SOFTWARE FOR SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS STILL RELIES ON HIGHLY LABORIOUS TASKS, MANUAL READING, AND A HOMOGENEOUS DATASET OF RESEARCH ARTICLES. THIS STUDY PROPOSES A FRAMEWORK THAT CAN ADDRESS THESE ISSUES, RETURN A COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF ITS, AND PROMOTE EFFICIENT SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS. THE PROPOSED FRAMEWORK CONSISTS OF NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) METHODS I.E., NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION (NER), LATENT DIRICHLET ALLOCATION (LDA), AND WORD EMBEDDING (CONTINUOUS SKIP-GRAM). IT ENABLES THIS STUDY TO EXPLORE THE CONTEXT OF RESEARCH ARTICLES AND THEIR OVERALL INTERPRETATION TO DETERMINE AND DEFINE THE DIRECTIONS OF KNOWLEDGE GROWTH AND ITS DEVELOPMENT. THE FRAMEWORK CAN SYSTEMATICALLY SEPARATE UNRELATED DOCUMENTS AND SIMPLIFY THE REVIEW PROCESS FOR LARGE DATASET. TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, COMPARED TO PRIOR RESEARCH REGARDING SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF ITS, THIS STUDY OFFERS MORE THOROUGH REVIEW.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
INTRINSIC EVALUATION OF CONTEXTUAL AND NON-CONTEXTUAL WORD EMBEDDINGS USING RADIOLOGY REPORTS. MANY CLINICAL NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING METHODS RELY ON NON-CONTEXTUAL WORD EMBEDDING (NCWE) OR CONTEXTUAL WORD EMBEDDING (CWE) MODELS. YET, FEW, IF ANY, INTRINSIC EVALUATION BENCHMARKS EXIST COMPARING EMBEDDING REPRESENTATIONS AGAINST CLINICIAN JUDGMENT. WE DEVELOPED INTRINSIC EVALUATION TASKS FOR EMBEDDING MODELS USING A CORPUS OF RADIOLOGY REPORTS: TERM PAIR SIMILARITY FOR NCWES AND CLOZE TASK ACCURACY FOR CWES. USING SURVEYS, WE QUANTIFIED THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN CLINICIAN JUDGMENT AND EMBEDDING MODEL REPRESENTATIONS.

INVESTIGATING THE EFFICIENT USE OF WORD EMBEDDING WITH NEURAL-TOPIC MODELS FOR INTERPRETABLE TOPICS FROM SHORT TEXTS. WITH THE RAPID PROLIFERATION OF SOCIAL NETWORKING SITES (SNS), AUTOMATIC TOPIC EXTRACTION FROM VARIOUS TEXT MESSAGES POSTED ON SNS ARE BECOMING AN IMPORTANT SOURCE OF INFORMATION FOR UNDERSTANDING CURRENT SOCIAL TRENDS OR NEEDS. LATENT DIRICHLET ALLOCATION (LDA), A PROBABILISTIC GENERATIVE MODEL, IS ONE OF THE POPULAR TOPIC MODELS IN THE AREA OF NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) AND HAS BEEN WIDELY USED IN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL, TOPIC EXTRACTION, AND DOCUMENT ANALYSIS. UNLIKE LONG TEXTS FROM FORMAL DOCUMENTS, MESSAGES ON SNS ARE GENERALLY SHORT. TRADITIONAL TOPIC MODELS SUCH AS LDA OR PLSA (PROBABILISTIC LATENT SEMANTIC ANALYSIS) SUFFER PERFORMANCE DEGRADATION FOR SHORT-TEXT ANALYSIS DUE TO A LACK OF WORD CO-OCCURRENCE INFORMATION IN EACH SHORT TEXT. TO COPE WITH THIS PROBLEM, VARIOUS TECHNIQUES ARE EVOLVING FOR INTERPRETABLE TOPIC MODELING FOR SHORT TEXTS, PRETRAINED WORD EMBEDDING WITH AN EXTERNAL CORPUS COMBINED WITH TOPIC MODELS IS ONE OF THEM. DUE TO RECENT DEVELOPMENTS OF DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS (DNN) AND DEEP GENERATIVE MODELS, NEURAL-TOPIC MODELS (NTM) ARE EMERGING TO ACHIEVE FLEXIBILITY AND HIGH PERFORMANCE IN TOPIC MODELING. HOWEVER, THERE ARE VERY FEW RESEARCH WORKS ON NEURAL-TOPIC MODELS WITH PRETRAINED WORD EMBEDDING FOR GENERATING HIGH-QUALITY TOPICS FROM SHORT TEXTS. IN THIS WORK, IN ADDITION TO PRETRAINED WORD EMBEDDING, A FINE-TUNING STAGE WITH AN ORIGINAL CORPUS IS PROPOSED FOR TRAINING NEURAL-TOPIC MODELS IN ORDER TO GENERATE SEMANTICALLY COHERENT, CORPUS-SPECIFIC TOPICS. AN EXTENSIVE STUDY WITH EIGHT NEURAL-TOPIC MODELS HAS BEEN COMPLETED TO CHECK THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ADDITIONAL FINE-TUNING AND PRETRAINED WORD EMBEDDING IN GENERATING INTERPRETABLE TOPICS BY SIMULATION EXPERIMENTS WITH SEVERAL BENCHMARK DATASETS. THE EXTRACTED TOPICS ARE EVALUATED BY DIFFERENT METRICS OF TOPIC COHERENCE AND TOPIC DIVERSITY. WE HAVE ALSO STUDIED THE PERFORMANCE OF THE MODELS IN CLASSIFICATION AND CLUSTERING TASKS. OUR STUDY CONCLUDES THAT THOUGH AUXILIARY WORD EMBEDDING WITH A LARGE EXTERNAL CORPUS IMPROVES THE TOPIC COHERENCY OF SHORT TEXTS, AN ADDITIONAL FINE-TUNING STAGE IS NEEDED FOR GENERATING MORE CORPUS-SPECIFIC TOPICS FROM SHORT-TEXT DATA.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
INVESTIGATING THE IMPACT OF PRE-PROCESSING TECHNIQUES AND PRE-TRAINED WORD EMBEDDINGS IN DETECTING ARABIC HEALTH INFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA. THIS PAPER PRESENTS A COMPREHENSIVE EVALUATION OF DATA PRE-PROCESSING AND WORD EMBEDDING TECHNIQUES IN THE CONTEXT OF ARABIC DOCUMENT CLASSIFICATION IN THE DOMAIN OF HEALTH-RELATED COMMUNICATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA. WE EVALUATE 26 TEXT PRE-PROCESSINGS APPLIED TO ARABIC TWEETS WITHIN THE PROCESS OF TRAINING A CLASSIFIER TO IDENTIFY HEALTH-RELATED TWEETS. FOR THIS TASK WE USE THE (TRADITIONAL) MACHINE LEARNING CLASSIFIERS KNN, SVM, MULTINOMIAL NB AND LOGISTIC REGRESSION. FURTHERMORE, WE REPORT EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS WITH THE DEEP LEARNING ARCHITECTURES BLSTM AND CNN FOR THE SAME TEXT CLASSIFICATION PROBLEM. SINCE WORD EMBEDDINGS ARE MORE TYPICALLY USED AS THE INPUT LAYER IN DEEP NETWORKS, IN THE DEEP LEARNING EXPERIMENTS WE EVALUATE SEVERAL STATE-OF-THE-ART PRE-TRAINED WORD EMBEDDINGS WITH THE SAME TEXT PRE-PROCESSING APPLIED. TO ACHIEVE THESE GOALS, WE USE TWO DATA SETS: ONE FOR BOTH TRAINING AND TESTING, AND ANOTHER FOR TESTING THE GENERALITY OF OUR MODELS ONLY. OUR RESULTS POINT TO THE CONCLUSION THAT ONLY FOUR OUT OF THE 26 PRE-PROCESSINGS IMPROVE THE CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY SIGNIFICANTLY. FOR THE FIRST DATA SET OF ARABIC TWEETS, WE FOUND THAT MAZAJAK CBOW PRE-TRAINED WORD EMBEDDINGS AS THE INPUT TO A BLSTM DEEP NETWORK LED TO THE MOST ACCURATE CLASSIFIER WITH F1 SCORE OF 89.7%. FOR THE SECOND DATA SET, MAZAJAK SKIP-GRAM PRE-TRAINED WORD EMBEDDINGS AS THE INPUT TO BLSTM LED TO THE MOST ACCURATE MODEL WITH F1 SCORE OF 75.2% AND ACCURACY OF 90.7% COMPARED TO F1 SCORE OF 90.8% ACHIEVED BY MAZAJAK CBOW FOR THE SAME ARCHITECTURE BUT WITH LOWER ACCURACY OF 70.89%. OUR RESULTS ALSO SHOW THAT THE PERFORMANCE OF THE BEST OF THE TRADITIONAL CLASSIFIER WE TRAINED IS COMPARABLE TO THE DEEP LEARNING METHODS ON THE FIRST DATASET, BUT SIGNIFICANTLY WORSE ON THE SECOND DATASET.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
INVESTIGATION OF THE UTILITY OF FEATURES IN A CLINICAL DE-IDENTIFICATION MODEL: A DEMONSTRATION USING EHR PATHOLOGY REPORTS FOR ADVANCED NSCLC PATIENTS. BACKGROUND: ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD (EHR) SYSTEMS CONTAIN A LARGE VOLUME OF TEXTS, INCLUDING VISIT NOTES, DISCHARGE SUMMARIES, AND VARIOUS REPORTS. TO PROTECT THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF PATIENTS, THESE RECORDS OFTEN NEED TO BE FULLY DE-IDENTIFIED BEFORE CIRCULATING FOR SECONDARY USE. MACHINE LEARNING (ML) BASED NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION (NER) MODEL HAS EMERGED AS A POPULAR TECHNIQUE OF AUTOMATIC DE-IDENTIFICATION. OBJECTIVE: THE PERFORMANCE OF A MACHINE LEARNING MODEL HIGHLY DEPENDS ON THE SELECTION OF APPROPRIATE FEATURES. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE USABILITY OF MULTIPLE FEATURES IN BUILDING A CONDITIONAL RANDOM FIELD (CRF) BASED CLINICAL DE-IDENTIFICATION NER MODEL. METHODS: USING OPEN-SOURCE NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) TOOLKITS, WE ANNOTATED PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION (PHI) IN 1,500 PATHOLOGY REPORTS AND BUILT SUPERVISED NER MODELS USING MULTIPLE FEATURES AND THEIR COMBINATIONS. WE FURTHER INVESTIGATED THE DEPENDENCY OF A MODEL'S PERFORMANCE ON THE SIZE OF TRAINING DATA. RESULTS: AMONG THE 10 FEATURE EXTRACTORS EXPLORED IN THIS STUDY, N-GRAM, PREFIX-SUFFIX, WORD EMBEDDING, AND WORD SHAPE PERFORMED THE BEST. A MODEL USING COMBINATION OF THESE FOUR FEATURE SETS YIELDED PRECISION, RECALL, AND F1-SCORE FOR EACH PHI AS FOLLOWS: NAME (0.80; 0.79; 0.80), LOCATION (0.85; 0.83; 0.84), DATE (0.86; 0.79; 0.82), HOSPITAL (0.96; 0.93; 0.95), ID (0.99; 0.82; 0.90), AND INITIALS (0.97; 0.49; 0.65). WE ALSO FOUND THAT THE MODEL'S PERFORMANCE BECOMES SATURATED WHEN THE TRAINING DATA SIZE IS BEYOND 200. CONCLUSION: MANUAL DE-IDENTIFICATION OF LARGE-SCALE DATA IS AN IMPRACTICAL PROCEDURE SINCE IT IS TIME-CONSUMING AND SUBJECT TO HUMAN ERRORS. ANALYSIS OF THE NER MODEL'S PERFORMANCE IN THIS STUDY SHEDS LIGHT ON A SEMI-AUTOMATIC CLINICAL DE-IDENTIFICATION PIPELINE FOR ENTERPRISE-WIDE DATA WAREHOUSING.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
IS THEOLOGY MORE OF A FIELD THAN A FATHER IS A KING? MODELLING SEMANTIC RELATEDNESS IN PROCESSING LITERAL AND METAPHORICAL STATEMENTS. ONE MAJOR QUESTION IN THE STUDY OF METAPHORS HISTORICALLY IS: ARE DIFFERENT MECHANISMS INVOLVED IN THE COMPREHENSION OF FIGURATIVE STATEMENTS VERSUS LITERAL STATEMENTS? MANY STUDIES HAVE ADDRESSED THIS QUESTION FROM A VARIETY OF PERSPECTIVES, WITH MIXED RESULTS. FOLLOWING HARATI, WESTBURY, AND KIAEE (BEHAVIOR RESEARCH METHODS, 53, 2214-2225, 2021), WE USE A COMPUTATIONAL (WORD EMBEDDING) MODEL OF SEMANTICS TO APPROACH THE QUESTION IN A WAY THAT ALLOWS FOR THE QUANTIFICATION OF THE SEMANTIC RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO KEYWORDS IN LITERAL AND METAPHORICAL "X IS A Y" STATEMENTS. WE FIRST DEMONSTRATE THAT ALMOST ALL LITERAL STATEMENTS (95.2% OF 582 STATEMENTS WE CONSIDERED) HAVE VERY HIGH RELATEDNESS VALUES. WE THEN SHOW THAT LITERALITY DECISIONS ARE SLOWER FOR LITERAL STATEMENTS WITH LOW RELATEDNESS AND METAPHORICAL STATEMENTS WITH HIGH RELATEDNESS. WE FIND A SIMILAR BUT SMALLER EFFECT ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE COSINE OF THE VECTORS REPRESENTING THE TWO KEYWORDS. THE FACT THAT THE SAME MEASURABLE CHARACTERISTICS ALLOW US TO PREDICT WHICH METAPHORS OR LITERAL SENTENCES WILL HAVE THE SLOWEST LITERALITY DECISION TIMES SUGGESTS THAT THE SAME PROCESSES UNDERLIE THE COMPREHENSION OF BOTH LITERAL AND METAPHORICAL STATEMENTS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
ITS2VEC: FUNGAL SPECIES IDENTIFICATION USING SEQUENCE EMBEDDING AND RANDOM FOREST CLASSIFICATION. FUNGI PLAY ESSENTIAL ROLES IN MANY ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES, AND TAXONOMIC CLASSIFICATION IS FUNDAMENTAL FOR MICROBIAL COMMUNITY CHARACTERIZATION AND VITAL FOR THE STUDY AND PRESERVATION OF FUNGAL BIODIVERSITY. TO COPE WITH MASSIVE FUNGAL BARCODE DATA, TOOLS THAT CAN IMPLEMENT EXTENSIVE VOLUMES OF BARCODE SEQUENCES, ESPECIALLY THE INTERNAL TRANSCRIBED SPACER (ITS) REGION, ARE NECESSARY. HOWEVER, HIGH VARIATION IN THE ITS REGION AND COMPUTATIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR PROCESSING HIGH-DIMENSIONAL FEATURES REMAIN CHALLENGING FOR EXISTING PREDICTORS. IN THIS STUDY, WE DEVELOPED ITS2VEC, A BIOINFORMATICS TOOL FOR THE CLASSIFICATION OF FUNGAL ITS BARCODES TO THE SPECIES LEVEL. AN ITS DATABASE COVERING MORE THAN 25,000 SPECIES IN A BROAD RANGE OF FUNGAL TAXA WAS ASSEMBLED. FOR DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION, A WORD EMBEDDING ALGORITHM WAS USED TO REPRESENT AN ITS SEQUENCE AS A DENSE LOW-DIMENSIONAL VECTOR. A RANDOM FOREST-BASED CLASSIFIER WAS BUILT FOR SPECIES IDENTIFICATION. BENCHMARKING RESULTS SHOWED THAT OUR MODEL ACHIEVED AN ACCURACY COMPARABLE TO THAT OF SEVERAL STATE-OF-THE-ART PREDICTORS, AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, IT COULD IMPLEMENT LARGE DATASETS AND GREATLY REDUCE DIMENSIONALITY. WE EXPECT THE ITS2VEC MODEL TO BE HELPFUL FOR FUNGAL SPECIES IDENTIFICATION AND, THUS, FOR REVEALING MICROBIAL COMMUNITY STRUCTURES AND IN DEEPENING OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR FUNCTIONAL MECHANISMS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
JUXTAPOSE: A GENE-EMBEDDING APPROACH FOR COMPARING CO-EXPRESSION NETWORKS. BACKGROUND: GENE CO-EXPRESSION NETWORKS (GCNS) ARE NOT EASILY COMPARABLE DUE TO THEIR COMPLEX STRUCTURE. IN THIS PAPER, WE PROPOSE A TOOL, JUXTAPOSE, TOGETHER WITH SIMILARITY MEASURES THAT CAN BE UTILIZED FOR COMPARATIVE TRANSCRIPTOMICS BETWEEN A SET OF ORGANISMS. WHILE WE FOCUS ON ITS APPLICATION TO COMPARING CO-EXPRESSION NETWORKS ACROSS SPECIES IN EVOLUTIONARY STUDIES, JUXTAPOSE IS ALSO GENERALIZABLE TO CO-EXPRESSION NETWORK COMPARISONS ACROSS TISSUES OR CONDITIONS WITHIN THE SAME SPECIES. METHODS: A WORD EMBEDDING STRATEGY COMMONLY USED IN NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING WAS UTILIZED IN ORDER TO GENERATE GENE EMBEDDINGS BASED ON WALKS MADE THROUGHOUT THE GCNS. JUXTAPOSE WAS EVALUATED BASED ON ITS ABILITY TO EMBED THE NODES OF SYNTHETIC STRUCTURES IN THE NETWORKS CONSISTENTLY WHILE ALSO GENERATING BIOLOGICALLY INFORMATIVE RESULTS. EVALUATION OF THE TECHNIQUES PROPOSED IN THIS RESEARCH UTILIZED RNA-SEQ DATASETS FROM GTEX, A MULTI-SPECIES EXPERIMENT OF PREFRONTAL CORTEX SAMPLES FROM THE GENE EXPRESSION OMNIBUS, AS WELL AS SYNTHESIZED DATASETS. BIOLOGICAL EVALUATION WAS PERFORMED USING GENE SET ENRICHMENT ANALYSIS AND KNOWN GENE RELATIONSHIPS IN LITERATURE. RESULTS: WE SHOW THAT JUXTAPOSE IS CAPABLE OF GLOBALLY ALIGNING SYNTHESIZED NETWORKS AS WELL AS IDENTIFYING AREAS THAT ARE CONSERVED IN REAL GENE CO-EXPRESSION NETWORKS WITHOUT RELIANCE ON EXTERNAL BIOLOGICAL INFORMATION. FURTHERMORE, OUTPUT FROM A MATCHING ALGORITHM THAT USES COSINE DISTANCE BETWEEN GCN EMBEDDINGS IS SHOWN TO BE AN INFORMATIVE MEASURE OF SIMILARITY THAT REFLECTS THE AMOUNT OF TOPOLOGICAL SIMILARITY BETWEEN NETWORKS. CONCLUSIONS: JUXTAPOSE CAN BE USED TO ALIGN GCNS WITHOUT RELYING ON KNOWN BIOLOGICAL SIMILARITIES AND ENABLES POST-HOC ANALYSES USING BIOLOGICAL PARAMETERS, SUCH AS ORTHOLOGY OF GENES, OR CONSERVED OR VARIABLE PATHWAYS.

KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY-BASED ANALYSIS OF HEALTH FACTORS OF URINARY INFECTIONS IN ELDERLY CARDIOLOGY INPATIENTS. A SET OF SEMANTIC SIMILARITY CALCULATION METHODS COMBINING FULL-TEXT TEXT AND DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE TOPICS IS PROPOSED FOR THE CURRENT STUDY OF ENTITY ASSOCIATION RELATIONS SUCH AS DISEASE-GENE IN MEDICAL TEXTS COMBINED WITH TOPICS IN KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY, WHICH IS INSUFFICIENT TO REVEAL THE DEEP SEMANTIC ASSOCIATION RELATIONS OF MEDICAL DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE AT TOPIC LEVEL. TAKING URINARY INFECTIONS IN ELDERLY INPATIENTS AS THE RESEARCH SUBJECT, WORD EMBEDDING REPRESENTATION OF WORD VECTORS AND TOPIC VECTORS IS PERFORMED BY THE TWE MODEL, AND SIMILARITY CALCULATION IS PERFORMED BY COMBINING TEXT AND DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE TOPICS BASED ON SIAMESE NETWORK FRAMEWORK. THE URINARY MICROBIOLOGICAL CULTURE RESULTS OF BOTH GROUPS WERE DOMINATED BY ESCHERICHIA COLI, ACCOUNTING FOR 34.65% AND 47.92%, RESPECTIVELY; THE USE OF ANTIMICROBIAL DRUGS IN THE SYMPTOMATIC URINARY INFECTION GROUP WAS 94.19% HIGHER THAN THAT IN THE ASYMPTOMATIC BACTERIURIA GROUP, 77.27% (X (2) = 8.158, P=0.004).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER FOR SURGICAL ACTIVITY PREDICTION. PURPOSE: LACK OF ANNOTATED TRAINING DATA HINDERS AUTOMATIC RECOGNITION AND PREDICTION OF SURGICAL ACTIVITIES NECESSARY FOR SITUATION-AWARE OPERATING ROOMS. WE PROPOSE USING KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER TO COMPENSATE FOR DATA DEFICIT AND IMPROVE PREDICTION. METHODS: WE USED TWO APPROACHES TO EXTRACT AND TRANSFER SURGICAL PROCESS KNOWLEDGE. FIRST, WE ENCODED SEMANTIC INFORMATION ABOUT SURGICAL TERMS USING WORD EMBEDDING. SECONDLY, WE PASSED KNOWLEDGE BETWEEN DIFFERENT CLINICAL DATASETS OF NEUROSURGICAL PROCEDURES USING TRANSFER LEARNING. RESULTS: THE COMBINATION OF TWO METHODS PROVIDED 22% IMPROVEMENT OF ACTIVITY PREDICTION. WE ALSO MADE SEVERAL PERTINENT OBSERVATIONS ABOUT SURGICAL PRACTICES BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THE PERFORMED TRANSFER. CONCLUSION: WORD EMBEDDING BOOSTS LEARNING PROCESS. TRANSFER LEARNING WAS SHOWN TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN A SIMPLE COMBINATION OF DATA, ESPECIALLY FOR LESS SIMILAR PROCEDURES.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
LABEL CO-OCCURRENCE LEARNING WITH GRAPH CONVOLUTIONAL NETWORKS FOR MULTI-LABEL CHEST X-RAY IMAGE CLASSIFICATION. EXISTING MULTI-LABEL MEDICAL IMAGE LEARNING TASKS GENERALLY CONTAIN RICH RELATIONSHIP INFORMATION AMONG PATHOLOGIES SUCH AS LABEL CO-OCCURRENCE AND INTERDEPENDENCY, WHICH IS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE FOR ASSISTING IN CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS AND CAN BE REPRESENTED AS THE GRAPH-STRUCTURED DATA. HOWEVER, MOST STATE-OF-THE-ART WORKS ONLY FOCUS ON REGRESSION FROM THE INPUT TO THE BINARY LABELS, FAILING TO MAKE FULL USE OF SUCH VALUABLE GRAPH-STRUCTURED INFORMATION DUE TO THE COMPLEXITY OF GRAPH DATA. IN THIS PAPER, WE PROPOSE A NOVEL LABEL CO-OCCURRENCE LEARNING FRAMEWORK BASED ON GRAPH CONVOLUTION NETWORKS (GCNS) TO EXPLICITLY EXPLORE THE DEPENDENCIES BETWEEN PATHOLOGIES FOR THE MULTI-LABEL CHEST X-RAY (CXR) IMAGE CLASSIFICATION TASK, WHICH WE TERM THE "CHEXGCN". SPECIFICALLY, THE PROPOSED CHEXGCN CONSISTS OF TWO MODULES, I.E., THE IMAGE FEATURE EMBEDDING (IFE) MODULE AND LABEL CO-OCCURRENCE LEARNING (LCL) MODULE. THANKS TO THE LCL MODEL, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PATHOLOGIES IS GENERALIZED INTO A SET OF CLASSIFIER SCORES BY INTRODUCING THE WORD EMBEDDING OF PATHOLOGIES AND MULTI-LAYER GRAPH INFORMATION PROPAGATION. DURING END-TO-END TRAINING, IT CAN BE FLEXIBLY INTEGRATED INTO THE IFE MODULE AND THEN ADAPTIVELY RECALIBRATE MULTI-LABEL OUTPUTS WITH THESE SCORES. EXTENSIVE EXPERIMENTS ON THE CHESTX-RAY14 AND CHEXPERT DATASETS HAVE DEMONSTRATED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CHEXGCN AS COMPARED WITH THE STATE-OF-THE-ART BASELINES.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
LARGE SCALE SUBJECT CATEGORY CLASSIFICATION OF SCHOLARLY PAPERS WITH DEEP ATTENTIVE NEURAL NETWORKS. SUBJECT CATEGORIES OF SCHOLARLY PAPERS GENERALLY REFER TO THE KNOWLEDGE DOMAIN(S) TO WHICH THE PAPERS BELONG, EXAMPLES BEING COMPUTER SCIENCE OR PHYSICS. SUBJECT CATEGORY CLASSIFICATION IS A PREREQUISITE FOR BIBLIOMETRIC STUDIES, ORGANIZING SCIENTIFIC PUBLICATIONS FOR DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE EXTRACTION, AND FACILITATING FACETED SEARCHES FOR DIGITAL LIBRARY SEARCH ENGINES. UNFORTUNATELY, MANY ACADEMIC PAPERS DO NOT HAVE SUCH INFORMATION AS PART OF THEIR METADATA. MOST EXISTING METHODS FOR SOLVING THIS TASK FOCUS ON UNSUPERVISED LEARNING THAT OFTEN RELIES ON CITATION NETWORKS. HOWEVER, A COMPLETE LIST OF PAPERS CITING THE CURRENT PAPER MAY NOT BE READILY AVAILABLE. IN PARTICULAR, NEW PAPERS THAT HAVE FEW OR NO CITATIONS CANNOT BE CLASSIFIED USING SUCH METHODS. HERE, WE PROPOSE A DEEP ATTENTIVE NEURAL NETWORK (DANN) THAT CLASSIFIES SCHOLARLY PAPERS USING ONLY THEIR ABSTRACTS. THE NETWORK IS TRAINED USING NINE MILLION ABSTRACTS FROM WEB OF SCIENCE (WOS). WE ALSO USE THE WOS SCHEMA THAT COVERS 104 SUBJECT CATEGORIES. THE PROPOSED NETWORK CONSISTS OF TWO BI-DIRECTIONAL RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORKS FOLLOWED BY AN ATTENTION LAYER. WE COMPARE OUR MODEL AGAINST BASELINES BY VARYING THE ARCHITECTURE AND TEXT REPRESENTATION. OUR BEST MODEL ACHIEVES MICRO- F 1 MEASURE OF 0.76 WITH F 1 OF INDIVIDUAL SUBJECT CATEGORIES RANGING FROM 0.50 TO 0.95. THE RESULTS SHOWED THE IMPORTANCE OF RETRAINING WORD EMBEDDING MODELS TO MAXIMIZE THE VOCABULARY OVERLAP AND THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE ATTENTION MECHANISM. THE COMBINATION OF WORD VECTORS WITH TFIDF OUTPERFORMS CHARACTER AND SENTENCE LEVEL EMBEDDING MODELS. WE DISCUSS IMBALANCED SAMPLES AND OVERLAPPING CATEGORIES AND SUGGEST POSSIBLE STRATEGIES FOR MITIGATION. WE ALSO DETERMINE THE SUBJECT CATEGORY DISTRIBUTION IN CITESEERX BY CLASSIFYING A RANDOM SAMPLE OF ONE MILLION ACADEMIC PAPERS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
LATENT TOPIC TEXT REPRESENTATION LEARNING ON STATISTICAL MANIFOLDS. THE EXPLOSIVE GROWTH OF TEXT DATA REQUIRES EFFECTIVE METHODS TO REPRESENT AND CLASSIFY THESE TEXTS. MANY TEXT LEARNING METHODS HAVE BEEN PROPOSED, LIKE STATISTICS-BASED METHODS, SEMANTIC SIMILARITY METHODS, AND DEEP LEARNING METHODS. THE STATISTICS-BASED METHODS FOCUS ON COMPARING THE SUBSTRUCTURE OF TEXT, WHICH IGNORES THE SEMANTIC SIMILARITY BETWEEN DIFFERENT WORDS. SEMANTIC SIMILARITY METHODS LEARN A TEXT REPRESENTATION BY TRAINING WORD EMBEDDING AND REPRESENTING TEXT AS THE AVERAGE VECTOR OF ALL WORDS. HOWEVER, THESE METHODS CANNOT CAPTURE THE TOPIC DIVERSITY OF WORDS AND TEXTS CLEARLY. RECENTLY, DEEP LEARNING METHODS SUCH AS CNNS AND RNNS HAVE BEEN STUDIED. HOWEVER, THE VANISHING GRADIENT PROBLEM AND TIME COMPLEXITY FOR PARAMETER SELECTION LIMIT THEIR APPLICATIONS. IN THIS PAPER, WE PROPOSE A NOVEL AND EFFICIENT TEXT LEARNING FRAMEWORK, NAMED LATENT TOPIC TEXT REPRESENTATION LEARNING. OUR METHOD AIMS TO PROVIDE AN EFFECTIVE TEXT REPRESENTATION AND TEXT MEASUREMENT WITH LATENT TOPICS. WITH THE ASSUMPTION THAT WORDS ON THE SAME TOPIC FOLLOW A GAUSSIAN DISTRIBUTION, TEXTS ARE REPRESENTED AS A MIXTURE OF TOPICS, I.E., A GAUSSIAN MIXTURE MODEL. OUR FRAMEWORK IS ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY MEASURE TEXT DISTANCE TO PERFORM TEXT CATEGORIZATION TASKS BY LEVERAGING STATISTICAL MANIFOLDS. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS ON TEXT REPRESENTATION AND CLASSIFICATION, AND TOPIC COHERENCE DEMONSTRATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROPOSED METHOD.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
LEARNING A FUNCTIONAL GRAMMAR OF PROTEIN DOMAINS USING NATURAL LANGUAGE WORD EMBEDDING TECHNIQUES. IN THIS PAPER, USING WORD2VEC, A WIDELY-USED NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING METHOD, WE DEMONSTRATE THAT PROTEIN DOMAINS MAY HAVE A LEARNABLE IMPLICIT SEMANTIC "MEANING" IN THE CONTEXT OF THEIR FUNCTIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE MULTI-DOMAIN PROTEINS IN WHICH THEY ARE FOUND. WORD2VEC IS A GROUP OF MODELS WHICH CAN BE USED TO PRODUCE SEMANTICALLY MEANINGFUL EMBEDDINGS OF WORDS OR TOKENS IN A FIXED-DIMENSION VECTOR SPACE. IN THIS WORK, WE TREAT MULTI-DOMAIN PROTEINS AS "SENTENCES" WHERE DOMAIN IDENTIFIERS ARE TOKENS WHICH MAY BE CONSIDERED AS "WORDS." USING ALL INTERPRO (FINN ET AL. 2017) PFAM DOMAIN ASSIGNMENTS WE OBSERVE THAT THE EMBEDDING COULD BE USED TO SUGGEST PUTATIVE GO ASSIGNMENTS FOR PFAM (FINN ET AL. 2016) DOMAINS OF UNKNOWN FUNCTION.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
LEARNING CONTEXTUAL HIERARCHICAL STRUCTURE OF MEDICAL CONCEPTS WITH POINCAIRE EMBEDDINGS TO CLARIFY PHENOTYPES. BIOMEDICAL ASSOCIATION STUDIES ARE INCREASINGLY DONE USING CLINICAL CONCEPTS, AND IN PARTICULAR DIAGNOSTIC CODES FROM CLINICAL DATA REPOSITORIES AS PHENOTYPES. CLINICAL CONCEPTS CAN BE REPRESENTED IN A MEANINGFUL, VECTOR SPACE USING WORD EMBEDDING MODELS. THESE EMBEDDINGS ALLOW FOR COMPARISON BETWEEN CLINICAL CONCEPTS OR FOR STRAIGHTFORWARD INPUT TO MACHINE LEARNING MODELS. USING TRADITIONAL APPROACHES, GOOD REPRESENTATIONS REQUIRE HIGH DIMENSIONALITY, MAKING DOWNSTREAM TASKS SUCH AS VISUALIZATION MORE DIFFICULT. WE APPLIED POINCARE EMBEDDINGS IN A 2-DIMENSIONAL HYPERBOLIC SPACE TO A LARGE-SCALE ADMINISTRATIVE CLAIMS DATABASE AND SHOW PERFORMANCE COMPARABLE TO 100-DIMENSIONAL EMBEDDINGS IN A EUCLIDEAN SPACE. WE THEN EXAMINE DISEASE RELATIONSHIPS UNDER DIFFERENT DISEASE CONTEXTS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND POTENTIAL PHENOTYPES.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
LEARNING DOCUMENT SEMANTIC REPRESENTATION WITH HYBRID DEEP BELIEF NETWORK. HIGH-LEVEL ABSTRACTION, FOR EXAMPLE, SEMANTIC REPRESENTATION, IS VITAL FOR DOCUMENT CLASSIFICATION AND RETRIEVAL. HOWEVER, HOW TO LEARN DOCUMENT SEMANTIC REPRESENTATION IS STILL A TOPIC OPEN FOR DISCUSSION IN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL AND NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING. IN THIS PAPER, WE PROPOSE A NEW HYBRID DEEP BELIEF NETWORK (HDBN) WHICH USES DEEP BOLTZMANN MACHINE (DBM) ON THE LOWER LAYERS TOGETHER WITH DEEP BELIEF NETWORK (DBN) ON THE UPPER LAYERS. THE ADVANTAGE OF DBM IS THAT IT EMPLOYS UNDIRECTED CONNECTION WHEN TRAINING WEIGHT PARAMETERS WHICH CAN BE USED TO SAMPLE THE STATES OF NODES ON EACH LAYER MORE SUCCESSFULLY AND IT IS ALSO AN EFFECTIVE WAY TO REMOVE NOISE FROM THE DIFFERENT DOCUMENT REPRESENTATION TYPE; THE DBN CAN ENHANCE EXTRACT ABSTRACT OF THE DOCUMENT IN DEPTH, MAKING THE MODEL LEARN SUFFICIENT SEMANTIC REPRESENTATION. AT THE SAME TIME, WE EXPLORE DIFFERENT INPUT STRATEGIES FOR SEMANTIC DISTRIBUTED REPRESENTATION. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS SHOW THAT OUR MODEL USING THE WORD EMBEDDING INSTEAD OF SINGLE WORD HAS BETTER PERFORMANCE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
LEARNING GRAPH CONVOLUTIONAL NETWORKS FOR MULTI-LABEL RECOGNITION AND APPLICATIONS. THE TASK OF MULTI-LABEL IMAGE RECOGNITION IS TO PREDICT A SET OF OBJECT LABELS THAT PRESENT IN AN IMAGE. AS OBJECTS NORMALLY CO-OCCUR IN AN IMAGE, IT IS DESIRABLE TO MODEL LABEL DEPENDENCIES TO IMPROVE RECOGNITION PERFORMANCE. TO CAPTURE AND EXPLORE SUCH IMPORTANT INFORMATION, WE PROPOSE GRAPH CONVOLUTIONAL NETWORKS BASED MODELS FOR MULTI-LABEL RECOGNITION, WHERE DIRECTED GRAPHS ARE CONSTRUCTED OVER CLASSES AND INFORMATION IS PROPAGATED BETWEEN CLASSES TO LEARN INTER-DEPENDENT CLASS-LEVEL REPRESENTATIONS. FOLLOWING THIS IDEA, WE DESIGN TWO PARTICULAR MODELS THAT APPROACH MULTI-LABEL CLASSIFICATION FROM DIFFERENT VIEWS. IN OUR FIRST MODEL, THE PRIOR KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE CLASS DEPENDENCIES IS INTEGRATED INTO CLASSIFIER LEARNING. SPECIFICALLY, WE PROPOSE CLASSIFIER-LEARNING-GCN TO MAP CLASS-LEVEL SEMANTIC REPRESENTATIONS (\EG, WORD EMBEDDING) INTO CLASSIFIERS THAT MAINTAIN THE INTER-CLASS TOPOLOGY. IN OUR SECOND MODEL, WE DECOMPOSE THE VISUAL REPRESENTATION OF AN IMAGE INTO A SET OF LABEL-AWARE FEATURES AND PROPOSE PREDICTION-LEARNING-GCN TO ENCODE SUCH FEATURES INTO INTER-DEPENDENT IMAGE-LEVEL PREDICTION SCORES. FURTHERMORE, WE ALSO PRESENT AN EFFECTIVE CORRELATION MATRIX CONSTRUCTION APPROACH TO CAPTURE INTER-CLASS RELATIONSHIPS AND CONSEQUENTLY GUIDE INFORMATION PROPAGATION AMONG CLASSES. EMPIRICAL RESULTS ON GENERIC MULTI-LABEL RECOGNITION DEMONSTRATE THAT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF BOTH TWO PROPOSED MODELS. MOREOVER, THE PROPOSED METHODS ALSO SHOW ADVANTAGES IN OTHER MULTI-LABEL RELATED APPLICATIONS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
LEARNING LINEAR TRANSFORMATIONS BETWEEN COUNTING-BASED AND PREDICTION-BASED WORD EMBEDDINGS. DESPITE THE GROWING INTEREST IN PREDICTION-BASED WORD EMBEDDING LEARNING METHODS, IT REMAINS UNCLEAR AS TO HOW THE VECTOR SPACES LEARNT BY THE PREDICTION-BASED METHODS DIFFER FROM THAT OF THE COUNTING-BASED METHODS, OR WHETHER ONE CAN BE TRANSFORMED INTO THE OTHER. TO STUDY THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN COUNTING-BASED AND PREDICTION-BASED EMBEDDINGS, WE PROPOSE A METHOD FOR LEARNING A LINEAR TRANSFORMATION BETWEEN TWO GIVEN SETS OF WORD EMBEDDINGS. OUR PROPOSAL CONTRIBUTES TO THE WORD EMBEDDING LEARNING RESEARCH IN THREE WAYS: (A) WE PROPOSE AN EFFICIENT METHOD TO LEARN A LINEAR TRANSFORMATION BETWEEN TWO SETS OF WORD EMBEDDINGS, (B) USING THE TRANSFORMATION LEARNT IN (A), WE EMPIRICALLY SHOW THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO PREDICT DISTRIBUTED WORD EMBEDDINGS FOR NOVEL UNSEEN WORDS, AND                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
LEARNING PORTUGUESE CLINICAL WORD EMBEDDINGS: A MULTI-SPECIALTY AND MULTI-INSTITUTIONAL CORPUS OF CLINICAL NARRATIVES SUPPORTING A DOWNSTREAM BIOMEDICAL TASK. IN THIS PAPER, WE TRAINED A SET OF PORTUGUESE CLINICAL WORD EMBEDDING MODELS OF DIFFERENT GRANULARITIES FROM MULTI-SPECIALTY AND MULTI-INSTITUTIONAL CLINICAL NARRATIVE DATASETS. THEN, WE ASSESSED THEIR IMPACT ON A DOWNSTREAM BIOMEDICAL NLP TASK OF URINARY TRACT INFECTION DISEASE IDENTIFICATION. ADDITIONALLY, WE INTRINSICALLY EVALUATED OUR MAIN MODEL USING AN ADAPTED VERSION OF BIO-SIMLEX FOR THE PORTUGUESE LANGUAGE. OUR EMPIRICAL RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE LARGER, COARSE-GRAINED MODEL ACHIEVED A SLIGHTLY BETTER OUTCOME WHEN COMPARED WITH THE SMALL, FINE-GRAINED MODEL IN THE PROPOSED TASK. MOREOVER, WE OBTAINED SATISFACTORY RESULTS WITH BIO-SIMLEX INTRINSIC EVALUATION.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
LEARNING REPRESENTATIONS FOR GENE ONTOLOGY TERMS BY JOINTLY ENCODING GRAPH STRUCTURE AND TEXTUAL NODE DESCRIPTORS. MEASURING THE SEMANTIC SIMILARITY BETWEEN GENE ONTOLOGY (GO) TERMS IS A FUNDAMENTAL STEP IN NUMEROUS FUNCTIONAL BIOINFORMATICS APPLICATIONS. TO FULLY EXPLOIT THE METADATA OF GO TERMS, WORD EMBEDDING-BASED METHODS HAVE BEEN PROPOSED RECENTLY TO MAP GO TERMS TO LOW-DIMENSIONAL FEATURE VECTORS. HOWEVER, THESE REPRESENTATION METHODS COMMONLY OVERLOOK THE KEY INFORMATION HIDDEN IN THE WHOLE GO STRUCTURE AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GO TERMS. IN THIS PAPER, WE PROPOSE A NOVEL REPRESENTATION MODEL FOR GO TERMS, NAMED GT2VEC, WHICH JOINTLY CONSIDERS THE GO GRAPH STRUCTURE OBTAINED BY GRAPH CONTRASTIVE LEARNING AND THE SEMANTIC DESCRIPTION OF GO TERMS BASED ON BERT ENCODERS. OUR METHOD IS EVALUATED ON A PROTEIN SIMILARITY TASK ON A COLLECTION OF BENCHMARK DATASETS. THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF USING A JOINT ENCODING GRAPH STRUCTURE AND TEXTUAL NODE DESCRIPTORS TO LEARN VECTOR REPRESENTATIONS FOR GO TERMS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
LEARNING TASKS OF PEDIATRIC PROVIDERS FROM ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD AUDIT LOGS. THE AMOUNT OF TIME SPENT WORKING IN THE ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD (EHR) HAS BECOME A BURDEN FOR MANY PROVIDERS. WE PROPOSE COMPUTATIONAL METHODS TO LEARN EHR TASKS OF PEDIATRICS RESIDENTS AND ATTENDING PHYSICIANS IN THE TREATMENT OF HEALTHY NEWBORNS BY ANALYZING EHR AUDIT LOG DATA. WE PERFORM STATISTICAL ANALYSES OF THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN EHR EVENTS AND PROVIDER ROLE, LEVERAGE WORD EMBEDDING, K-MEANS, AND PROM PROCESS MINING SOFTWARE ON AUDIT LOG DATA TO LEARN EHR TASKS AND VISUALIZE THEM. RESIDENTS MORE COMMONLY PERFORM NOTE PREPARATION AND RESULT VIEWING RELATIVE TO ATTENDINGS. ATTENDINGS PERFORM MORE COMMUNICATION AND CHART REVIEW. TASK WORKFLOWS ANALYSIS RESULTED IN 2 TASKS FOR ATTENDINGS AND 3 TASKS FOR RESIDENTS. THE ATTENDING TASKS FOCUS ON CHART REVIEW PATIENT REPORT AND HISTORY, AND INBOX SERVICE. PRIMARY THEMES FOR RESIDENTS ARE ADMIT/DISCHARGE WITH ORDER CREATION, NOTE REVIEW, AND RESULT REVIEW.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
LEARNING TO MODEL RELATIONSHIPS FOR ZERO-SHOT VIDEO CLASSIFICATION. WITH THE EXPLOSIVE GROWTH OF VIDEO CATEGORIES, ZERO-SHOT LEARNING (ZSL) IN VIDEO CLASSIFICATION HAS BECOME A PROMISING RESEARCH DIRECTION IN PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE LEARNING. BASED ON SOME AUXILIARY INFORMATION SUCH AS WORD EMBEDDINGS AND ATTRIBUTES, THE KEY TO A ROBUST ZSL METHOD IS TO TRANSFER THE LEARNED KNOWLEDGE FROM SEEN CLASSES TO UNSEEN CLASSES, WHICH REQUIRES RELATIONSHIP MODELING BETWEEN THESE CONCEPTS (E.G., CATEGORIES AND ATTRIBUTES). HOWEVER, MOST EXISTING APPROACHES IGNORE TO MODEL THE EXPLICIT RELATIONSHIPS IN AN END-TO-END MANNER, RESULTING IN LOW EFFECTIVENESS OF KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER. TO TACKLE THIS PROBLEM, WE RECONSIDER THE VIDEO ZSL TASK AS A TASK-DRIVEN MESSAGE PASSING PROCESS TO JOINTLY ENJOY SEVERAL MERITS INCLUDING ALLEVIATED HETEROGENEITY GAP, LOW DOMAIN SHIFT, AND ROBUST TEMPORAL MODELING. SPECIFICALLY, WE PROPOSE A PROTOTYPE-SAMPLE GNN (PS-GNN) CONSISTING OF A PROTOTYPE BRANCH AND A SAMPLE BRANCH TO DIRECTLY AND ADAPTIVELY MODEL ALL THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN CATEGORY-ATTRIBUTE, CATEGORY-CATEGORY, AND ATTRIBUTE-ATTRIBUTE. THE PROTOTYPE BRANCH AIMS TO LEARN ROBUST REPRESENTATIONS OF VIDEO CATEGORIES, WHICH TAKES AS INPUT A SET OF WORD-EMBEDDING VECTORS CORRESPONDING TO THE CONCEPTS. THE SAMPLE BRANCH IS DESIGNED TO GENERATE FEATURES OF A VIDEO SAMPLE BY LEVERAGING ITS OBJECT SEMANTICS. WITH THE CO-ADAPTION AND COOPERATION BETWEEN BOTH BRANCHES, A UNIFIED AND ROBUST ZSL FRAMEWORK IS ACHIEVED. EXTENSIVE EXPERIMENTS STRONGLY EVIDENCE THAT PS-GNN OBTAINS FAVORABLE PERFORMANCE ON FIVE POPULAR VIDEO BENCHMARKS CONSISTENTLY.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
LEXICON DEVELOPMENT FOR COVID-19-RELATED CONCEPTS USING OPEN-SOURCE WORD EMBEDDING SOURCES: AN INTRINSIC AND EXTRINSIC EVALUATION. BACKGROUND: SCIENTISTS ARE DEVELOPING NEW COMPUTATIONAL METHODS AND PREDICTION MODELS TO BETTER CLINICALLY UNDERSTAND COVID-19 PREVALENCE, TREATMENT EFFICACY, AND PATIENT OUTCOMES. THESE EFFORTS COULD BE IMPROVED BY LEVERAGING DOCUMENTED COVID-19-RELATED SYMPTOMS, FINDINGS, AND DISORDERS FROM CLINICAL TEXT SOURCES IN AN ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD. WORD EMBEDDINGS CAN IDENTIFY TERMS RELATED TO THESE CLINICAL CONCEPTS FROM BOTH THE BIOMEDICAL AND NONBIOMEDICAL DOMAINS, AND ARE BEING SHARED WITH THE OPEN-SOURCE COMMUNITY AT LARGE. HOWEVER, IT'S UNCLEAR HOW USEFUL OPENLY AVAILABLE WORD EMBEDDINGS ARE FOR DEVELOPING LEXICONS FOR COVID-19-RELATED CONCEPTS. OBJECTIVE: GIVEN AN INITIAL LEXICON OF COVID-19-RELATED TERMS, THIS STUDY AIMS TO CHARACTERIZE THE RETURNED TERMS BY SIMILARITY ACROSS VARIOUS OPEN-SOURCE WORD EMBEDDINGS AND DETERMINE COMMON SEMANTIC AND SYNTACTIC PATTERNS BETWEEN THE COVID-19 QUERIED TERMS AND RETURNED TERMS SPECIFIC TO THE WORD EMBEDDING SOURCE. METHODS: WE COMPARED SEVEN OPENLY AVAILABLE WORD EMBEDDING SOURCES. USING A SERIES OF COVID-19-RELATED TERMS FOR ASSOCIATED SYMPTOMS, FINDINGS, AND DISORDERS, WE CONDUCTED AN INTERANNOTATOR AGREEMENT STUDY TO DETERMINE HOW ACCURATELY THE MOST SIMILAR RETURNED TERMS COULD BE CLASSIFIED ACCORDING TO SEMANTIC TYPES BY THREE ANNOTATORS. WE CONDUCTED A QUALITATIVE STUDY OF COVID-19 QUERIED TERMS AND THEIR RETURNED TERMS TO DETECT INFORMATIVE PATTERNS FOR CONSTRUCTING LEXICONS. WE DEMONSTRATED THE UTILITY OF APPLYING SUCH LEARNED SYNONYMS TO DISCHARGE SUMMARIES BY REPORTING THE PROPORTION OF PATIENTS IDENTIFIED BY CONCEPT AMONG THREE PATIENT COHORTS: PNEUMONIA (N=6410), ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (N=8647), AND COVID-19 (N=2397). RESULTS: WE OBSERVED HIGH PAIRWISE INTERANNOTATOR AGREEMENT (COHEN KAPPA) FOR SYMPTOMS (0.86-0.99), FINDINGS (0.93-0.99), AND DISORDERS (0.93-0.99). WORD EMBEDDING SOURCES GENERATED BASED ON CHARACTERS TEND TO RETURN MORE SYNONYMS (MEAN COUNT OF 7.2 SYNONYMS) COMPARED TO TOKEN-BASED EMBEDDING SOURCES (MEAN COUNTS RANGE FROM 2.0 TO 3.4). WORD EMBEDDING SOURCES QUERIED USING A QUALIFIER TERM (EG, DRY COUGH OR MUSCLE PAIN) MORE OFTEN RETURNED QUALIFIERS OF THE SIMILAR SEMANTIC TYPE (EG, "DRY" RETURNS CONSISTENCY QUALIFIERS LIKE "WET" AND "RUNNY") COMPARED TO A SINGLE TERM (EG, COUGH OR PAIN) QUERIES. A HIGHER PROPORTION OF PATIENTS HAD DOCUMENTED FEVER (0.61-0.84), COUGH (0.41-0.55), SHORTNESS OF BREATH (0.40-0.59), AND HYPOXIA (0.51-0.56) RETRIEVED THAN OTHER CLINICAL FEATURES. TERMS FOR DRY COUGH RETURNED A HIGHER PROPORTION OF PATIENTS WITH COVID-19 (0.07) THAN THE PNEUMONIA (0.05) AND ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (0.03) POPULATIONS. CONCLUSIONS: WORD EMBEDDINGS ARE VALUABLE TECHNOLOGY FOR LEARNING RELATED TERMS, INCLUDING SYNONYMS. WHEN LEVERAGING OPENLY AVAILABLE WORD EMBEDDING SOURCES, CHOICES MADE FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE WORD EMBEDDINGS CAN SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCE THE WORDS LEARNED.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
LINGUISTIC PATTERNS FOR CODE WORD RESILIENT HATE SPEECH IDENTIFICATION. THE PERMANENT TRANSITION TO ONLINE ACTIVITY HAS BROUGHT WITH IT A SURGE IN HATE SPEECH DISCOURSE. THIS HAS PROMPTED INCREASED CALLS FOR AUTOMATIC DETECTION METHODS, MOST OF WHICH CURRENTLY RELY ON A DICTIONARY OF HATE SPEECH WORDS, AND SUPERVISED CLASSIFICATION. THIS APPROACH OFTEN FALLS SHORT WHEN DEALING WITH NEWER WORDS AND PHRASES PRODUCED BY ONLINE EXTREMIST COMMUNITIES. THESE CODE WORDS ARE USED WITH THE AIM OF EVADING AUTOMATIC DETECTION BY SYSTEMS. CODE WORDS ARE FREQUENTLY USED AND HAVE BENIGN MEANINGS IN REGULAR DISCOURSE, FOR INSTANCE, "SKYPES, GOOGLES, BING, YAHOOS" ARE ALL EXAMPLES OF WORDS THAT HAVE A HIDDEN HATE SPEECH MEANING. SUCH OVERLAP PRESENTS A CHALLENGE TO THE TRADITIONAL KEYWORD APPROACH OF COLLECTING DATA THAT IS SPECIFIC TO HATE SPEECH. IN THIS WORK, WE FIRST INTRODUCED A WORD EMBEDDING MODEL THAT LEARNS THE HIDDEN HATE SPEECH MEANING OF WORDS. WITH THIS INSIGHT ON CODE WORDS, WE DEVELOPED A CLASSIFIER THAT LEVERAGES LINGUISTIC PATTERNS TO REDUCE THE IMPACT OF INDIVIDUAL WORDS. THE PROPOSED METHOD WAS EVALUATED ACROSS THREE DIFFERENT DATASETS TO TEST ITS GENERALIZABILITY. THE EMPIRICAL RESULTS SHOW THAT THE LINGUISTIC PATTERNS APPROACH OUTPERFORMS THE BASELINES AND ENABLES FURTHER ANALYSIS ON HATE SPEECH EXPRESSIONS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
MACHINE-GUIDED POLYMER KNOWLEDGE EXTRACTION USING NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING: THE EXAMPLE OF NAMED ENTITY NORMALIZATION. A RICH BODY OF LITERATURE HAS EMERGED IN RECENT YEARS THAT DISCUSSES THE EXTRACTION OF STRUCTURED INFORMATION FROM MATERIALS SCIENCE TEXT THROUGH NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION MODELS. RELATIVELY LITTLE WORK HAS BEEN DONE TO ADDRESS THE "NORMALIZATION" OF EXTRACTED ENTITIES, THAT IS, RECOGNIZING THAT TWO OR MORE SEEMINGLY DIFFERENT ENTITIES ACTUALLY REFER TO THE SAME ENTITY IN REALITY. IN THIS WORK, WE ADDRESS THE NORMALIZATION OF POLYMER NAMED ENTITIES, POLYMERS BEING A CLASS OF MATERIALS THAT OFTEN HAVE A VARIETY OF COMMON NAMES FOR THE SAME MATERIAL IN ADDITION TO THE IUPAC NAME. WE HAVE TRAINED SUPERVISED CLUSTERING MODELS USING WORD2VEC AND FASTTEXT WORD EMBEDDINGS REPORTED IN PREVIOUS WORK SO THAT NAMED ENTITIES REFERRING TO THE SAME POLYMER ARE CATEGORIZED WITHIN THE SAME CLUSTER IN THE WORD EMBEDDING SPACE. WE REPORT THE USE OF PARAMETERIZED COSINE DISTANCE FUNCTIONS TO CLUSTER AND NORMALIZE TEXTUALLY DERIVED ENTITIES, ACHIEVING AN F1 SCORE OF 0.85. FURTHERMORE, A LABELED DATA SET OF POLYMER NAMES WAS UTILIZED TO TRAIN OUR MODEL AND TO INFER THE TRUE TOTAL NUMBER OF UNIQUE POLYMERS THAT ARE ACTIVELY REPORTED IN THE LITERATURE. FOR APPROXIMATELY 15,500 POLYMER NAMED ENTITIES EXTRACTED FROM OUR CORPUS OF 0.5 MILLION PAPERS, WE DETECTED 6734 UNIQUE CLUSTERS (I.E., UNIQUE POLYMERS), 632 OF WHICH WERE MANUALLY CURATED TO TRAIN THE NORMALIZATION MODEL. THIS WORK WILL SERVE AS A CRITICAL INGREDIENT IN A NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING-BASED PIPELINE FOR THE AUTOMATIC AND EFFICIENT EXTRACTION OF KNOWLEDGE FROM THE POLYMER LITERATURE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
MEASURING NOVELTY IN SCIENCE WITH WORD EMBEDDING. NOVELTY IS A CORE VALUE IN SCIENCE, AND A RELIABLE MEASUREMENT OF NOVELTY IS CRUCIAL. THIS STUDY PROPOSES A NEW APPROACH OF MEASURING THE NOVELTY OF SCIENTIFIC ARTICLES BASED ON BOTH CITATION DATA AND TEXT DATA. THE PROPOSED APPROACH CONSIDERS AN ARTICLE TO BE NOVEL IF IT CITES A COMBINATION OF SEMANTICALLY DISTANT REFERENCES. TO THIS END, WE FIRST ASSIGN A WORD EMBEDDING-A VECTOR REPRESENTATION OF EACH VOCABULARY-TO EACH CITED REFERENCE ON THE BASIS OF TEXT INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THE REFERENCE. WITH THESE VECTORS, A DISTANCE BETWEEN EVERY PAIR OF REFERENCES IS COMPUTED. FINALLY, THE NOVELTY OF A FOCAL DOCUMENT IS EVALUATED BY SUMMARIZING THE DISTANCES BETWEEN ALL REFERENCES. THE APPROACH DRAWS ON LIMITED TEXT INFORMATION (THE TITLES OF REFERENCES) AND PUBLICLY SHARED LIBRARY FOR WORD EMBEDDINGS, WHICH MINIMIZES THE REQUIREMENT OF DATA ACCESS AND COMPUTATIONAL COST. WE SHARE THE CODE, WITH WHICH ONE CAN COMPUTE THE NOVELTY SCORE OF A DOCUMENT OF INTEREST ONLY BY HAVING THE FOCAL DOCUMENT'S REFERENCE LIST. WE VALIDATE THE PROPOSED MEASURE THROUGH THREE EXERCISES. FIRST, WE CONFIRM THAT WORD EMBEDDINGS CAN BE USED TO QUANTIFY SEMANTIC DISTANCES BETWEEN DOCUMENTS BY COMPARING WITH AN ESTABLISHED BIBLIOMETRIC DISTANCE MEASURE. SECOND, WE CONFIRM THE CRITERION-RELATED VALIDITY OF THE PROPOSED NOVELTY MEASURE WITH SELF-REPORTED NOVELTY SCORES COLLECTED FROM A QUESTIONNAIRE SURVEY. FINALLY, AS NOVELTY IS KNOWN TO BE CORRELATED WITH FUTURE CITATION IMPACT, WE CONFIRM THAT THE PROPOSED MEASURE CAN PREDICT FUTURE CITATION.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
MEASURING RELATIVE OPINION FROM LOCATION-BASED SOCIAL MEDIA: A CASE STUDY OF THE 2016 U.S. PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. SOCIAL MEDIA HAS BECOME AN EMERGING ALTERNATIVE TO OPINION POLLS FOR PUBLIC OPINION COLLECTION, WHILE IT IS STILL POSING MANY CHALLENGES AS A PASSIVE DATA SOURCE, SUCH AS STRUCTURELESSNESS, QUANTIFIABILITY, AND REPRESENTATIVENESS. SOCIAL MEDIA DATA WITH GEOTAGS PROVIDE NEW OPPORTUNITIES TO UNVEIL THE GEOGRAPHIC LOCATIONS OF USERS EXPRESSING THEIR OPINIONS. THIS PAPER AIMS TO ANSWER TWO QUESTIONS: 1) WHETHER QUANTIFIABLE MEASUREMENT OF PUBLIC OPINION CAN BE OBTAINED FROM SOCIAL MEDIA AND 2) WHETHER IT CAN PRODUCE BETTER OR COMPLEMENTARY MEASURES COMPARED TO OPINION POLLS. THIS RESEARCH PROPOSES A NOVEL APPROACH TO MEASURE THE RELATIVE OPINION OF TWITTER USERS TOWARDS PUBLIC ISSUES IN ORDER TO ACCOMMODATE MORE COMPLEX OPINION STRUCTURES AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE GEOGRAPHY PERTAINING TO THE PUBLIC ISSUES. TO ENSURE THAT THIS NEW MEASURE IS TECHNICALLY FEASIBLE, A MODELING FRAMEWORK IS DEVELOPED INCLUDING BUILDING A TRAINING DATASET BY ADOPTING A STATE-OF-THE-ART APPROACH AND DEVISING A NEW DEEP LEARNING METHOD CALLED OPINION-ORIENTED WORD EMBEDDING. WITH A CASE STUDY OF TWEETS ON THE 2016 U.S. PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, WE DEMONSTRATE THE PREDICTIVE SUPERIORITY OF OUR RELATIVE OPINION APPROACH AND WE SHOW HOW IT CAN AID VISUAL ANALYTICS AND SUPPORT OPINION PREDICTIONS. ALTHOUGH THE RELATIVE OPINION MEASURE IS PROVED TO BE MORE ROBUST THAN POLLING, OUR STUDY ALSO SUGGESTS THAT THE FORMER CAN ADVANTAGEOUSLY COMPLEMENT THE LATTER IN OPINION PREDICTION.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE EXTRACTION AND ANALYSIS FROM ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS USING DEEP LEARNING. OBJECTIVES MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE EXTRACTION (MKE) PLAYS A KEY ROLE IN NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) RESEARCH IN ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS (EMR), WHICH ARE THE IMPORTANT DIGITAL CARRIERS FOR RECORDING MEDICAL ACTIVITIES OF PATIENTS. NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION (NER) AND MEDICAL RELATION EXTRACTION (MRE) ARE TWO BASIC TASKS OF MKE. THIS STUDY AIMS TO IMPROVE THE RECOGNITION ACCURACY OF THESE TWO TASKS BY EXPLORING DEEP LEARNING METHODS. METHODS THIS STUDY DISCUSSED AND BUILT TWO APPLICATION SCENES OF BIDIRECTIONAL LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY COMBINED CONDITIONAL RANDOM FIELD (BILSTM-CRF) MODEL FOR NER AND MRE TASKS. IN THE DATA PREPROCESSING OF BOTH TASKS, A GLOVE WORD EMBEDDING MODEL WAS USED TO VECTORIZE WORDS. IN THE NER TASK, A SEQUENCE LABELING STRATEGY WAS USED TO CLASSIFY EACH WORD TAG BY THE JOINT PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION THROUGH THE CRF LAYER. IN THE MRE TASK, THE MEDICAL ENTITY RELATION CATEGORY WAS PREDICTED BY TRANSFORMING THE CLASSIFICATION PROBLEM OF A SINGLE ENTITY INTO A SEQUENCE CLASSIFICATION PROBLEM AND LINKING THE FEATURE COMBINATIONS BETWEEN ENTITIES ALSO THROUGH THE CRF LAYER. RESULTS THROUGH THE VALIDATION ON THE I2B2 2010 PUBLIC DATASET, THE BILSTM-CRF MODELS BUILT IN THIS STUDY GOT MUCH BETTER RESULTS THAN THE BASELINE METHODS IN THE TWO TASKS, WHERE THE F1-MEASURE WAS UP TO 0.88 IN NER TASK AND 0.78 IN MRE TASK. MOREOVER, THE MODEL CONVERGED FASTER AND AVOIDED PROBLEMS SUCH AS OVERFITTING. CONCLUSION THIS STUDY PROVED THE GOOD PERFORMANCE OF DEEP LEARNING ON MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE EXTRACTION. IT ALSO VERIFIED THE FEASIBILITY OF THE BILSTM-CRF MODEL IN DIFFERENT APPLICATION SCENARIOS, LAYING THE FOUNDATION FOR THE SUBSEQUENT WORK IN THE EMR FIELD.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
MEDICAL NAMED ENTITY EXTRACTION FROM CHINESE RESIDENT ADMIT NOTES USING CHARACTER AND WORD ATTENTION-ENHANCED NEURAL NETWORK. THE RESIDENT ADMIT NOTES (RANS) IN ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS (EMRS) IS FIRST-HAND INFORMATION TO STUDY THE PATIENT'S CONDITION. MEDICAL ENTITY EXTRACTION OF RANS IS AN IMPORTANT TASK TO GET DISEASE INFORMATION FOR MEDICAL DECISION-MAKING. FOR CHINESE ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS, EACH MEDICAL ENTITY CONTAINS NOT ONLY WORD INFORMATION BUT ALSO RICH CHARACTER INFORMATION. EFFECTIVE COMBINATION OF WORDS AND CHARACTERS IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR MEDICAL ENTITY EXTRACTION. WE PROPOSE A MEDICAL ENTITY RECOGNITION MODEL BASED ON A CHARACTER AND WORD ATTENTION-ENHANCED (CWAE) NEURAL NETWORK FOR CHINESE RANS. IN OUR MODEL, WORD EMBEDDINGS AND CHARACTER-BASED EMBEDDINGS ARE OBTAINED THROUGH CHARACTER-ENHANCED WORD EMBEDDING (CWE) MODEL AND CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (CNN) MODEL. THEN ATTENTION MECHANISM COMBINES THE CHARACTER-BASED EMBEDDINGS AND WORD EMBEDDINGS TOGETHER, WHICH SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVES THE EXPRESSION ABILITY OF WORDS. THE NEW WORD EMBEDDINGS OBTAINED BY THE ATTENTION MECHANISM ARE TAKEN AS THE INPUT TO BIDIRECTIONAL LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY (BI-LSTM) AND CONDITIONAL RANDOM FIELD (CRF) TO EXTRACT ENTITIES. WE EXTRACTED NINE TYPES OF KEY MEDICAL ENTITIES FROM CHINESE RANS AND EVALUATED OUR MODEL. THE PROPOSED METHOD WAS COMPARED WITH TWO TRADITIONAL MACHINE LEARNING METHODS CRF, SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE (SVM), AND THE RELATED DEEP LEARNING MODELS. THE RESULT SHOWS THAT OUR MODEL HAS BETTER PERFORMANCE, AND THE RESULT OF OUR MODEL REACHES 94.44% IN THE F1-SCORE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
MEDICAL TERMINOLOGY-BASED COMPUTING SYSTEM: A LIGHTWEIGHT POST-PROCESSING SOLUTION FOR OUT-OF-VOCABULARY MULTI-WORD TERMS. THE LINGUISTIC RULES OF MEDICAL TERMINOLOGY ASSIST IN GAINING ACQUAINTANCE WITH RARE/COMPLEX CLINICAL AND BIOMEDICAL TERMS. THE MEDICAL LANGUAGE FOLLOWS A GREEK AND LATIN-INSPIRED NOMENCLATURE. THIS NOMENCLATURE AIDS THE STAKEHOLDERS IN SIMPLIFYING THE MEDICAL TERMS AND GAINING SEMANTIC FAMILIARITY. HOWEVER, NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING MODELS MISREPRESENT RARE AND COMPLEX BIOMEDICAL WORDS. IN THIS STUDY, WE PRESENT MEDTCS-A LIGHTWEIGHT, POST-PROCESSING MODULE-TO SIMPLIFY HYBRIDIZED OR COMPOUND TERMS INTO REGULAR WORDS USING MEDICAL NOMENCLATURE. MEDTCS ENABLED THE WORD-BASED EMBEDDING MODELS TO ACHIEVE 100% COVERAGE AND ENABLED THE BIOWORDVEC MODEL TO ACHIEVE HIGH CORRELATION SCORES (0.641 AND 0.603 IN UMNSRS SIMILARITY AND RELATEDNESS DATASETS, RESPECTIVELY) THAT SIGNIFICANTLY SURPASS THE N-GRAM AND SUB-WORD APPROACHES OF FASTTEXT AND BERT. IN THE DOWNSTREAM TASK OF NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION (NER), MEDTCS ENABLED THE LATEST CLINICAL EMBEDDING MODEL OF FASTTEXT-OA-ALL-300D TO IMPROVE THE F1-SCORE FROM 0.45 TO 0.80 ON THE BC5CDR CORPUS AND FROM 0.59 TO 0.81 ON THE NCBI-DISEASE CORPUS, RESPECTIVELY. SIMILARLY, IN THE DRUG INDICATION CLASSIFICATION TASK, OUR MODEL WAS ABLE TO INCREASE THE COVERAGE BY 9% AND THE F1-SCORE BY 1%. OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT INCORPORATING A MEDICAL TERMINOLOGY-BASED MODULE PROVIDES DISTINCTIVE CONTEXTUAL CLUES TO ENHANCE VOCABULARY AS A POST-PROCESSING STEP ON PRE-TRAINED EMBEDDINGS. WE DEMONSTRATE THAT THE PROPOSED MODULE ENABLES THE WORD EMBEDDING MODELS TO GENERATE VECTORS OF OUT-OF-VOCABULARY WORDS EFFECTIVELY. WE EXPECT THAT OUR STUDY CAN BE A STEPPING STONE FOR THE USE OF BIOMEDICAL KNOWLEDGE-DRIVEN RESOURCES IN NLP.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
METABOLISTEM AND TABOLISTM: TWO DEEP LEARNING ALGORITHMS FOR METABOLITE NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION. REVIEWING THE METABOLOMICS LITERATURE IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT BECAUSE OF THE RAPID EXPANSION OF RELEVANT JOURNAL LITERATURE. TEXT-MINING TECHNOLOGIES ARE THEREFORE NEEDED TO FACILITATE MORE EFFICIENT LITERATURE REVIEWS. HERE WE CONTRIBUTE A STANDARDISED CORPUS OF FULL-TEXT PUBLICATIONS FROM METABOLOMICS STUDIES AND DESCRIBE THE DEVELOPMENT OF TWO METABOLITE NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION (NER) METHODS. THESE METHODS ARE BASED ON BIDIRECTIONAL LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY (BILSTM) NETWORKS AND EACH INCORPORATE DIFFERENT TRANSFER LEARNING TECHNIQUES (FOR TOKENISATION AND WORD EMBEDDING). OUR FIRST MODEL (METABOLISTEM) FOLLOWS PRIOR METHODOLOGY USING GLOVE WORD EMBEDDINGS. OUR SECOND MODEL EXPLOITS BERT AND BIOBERT FOR EMBEDDING AND IS NAMED TABOLISTM (TRANSFORMER-AFFIXED BILSTM). THE METHODS ARE TRAINED ON A NOVEL CORPUS ANNOTATED USING RULE-BASED METHODS, AND EVALUATED ON MANUALLY ANNOTATED METABOLOMICS ARTICLES. METABOLISTEM (F1-SCORE 0.890, PRECISION 0.892, RECALL 0.888) AND TABOLISTM (BIOBERT VERSION: F1-SCORE 0.909, PRECISION 0.926, RECALL 0.893) HAVE ACHIEVED STATE-OF-THE-ART PERFORMANCE ON METABOLITE NER. A TRAINING CORPUS WITH FULL-TEXT SENTENCES FROM &GT;1000 FULL-TEXT OPEN ACCESS METABOLOMICS PUBLICATIONS WITH 105,335 ANNOTATED METABOLITES WAS CREATED, AS WELL AS A MANUALLY ANNOTATED TEST CORPUS (19,138 ANNOTATIONS). THIS WORK DEMONSTRATES THAT DEEP LEARNING ALGORITHMS ARE CAPABLE OF IDENTIFYING METABOLITE NAMES ACCURATELY AND EFFICIENTLY IN TEXT. THE PROPOSED CORPUS AND NER ALGORITHMS CAN BE USED FOR METABOLOMICS TEXT-MINING TASKS SUCH AS INFORMATION RETRIEVAL, DOCUMENT CLASSIFICATION AND LITERATURE-BASED DISCOVERY AND ARE AVAILABLE FROM THE OMICSNLP GITHUB REPOSITORY.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
METAMLP: A FAST WORD EMBEDDING BASED CLASSIFIER TO PROFILE TARGET GENE DATABASES IN METAGENOMIC SAMPLES. THE FUNCTIONAL PROFILE OF METAGENOMIC SAMPLES ENABLES IMPROVED UNDERSTANDING OF MICROBIAL POPULATIONS IN THE ENVIRONMENT. SUCH ANALYSIS CONSISTS OF ASSIGNING SHORT SEQUENCING READS TO A PARTICULAR FUNCTIONAL CATEGORY. NORMALLY, MANUALLY CURATED DATABASES ARE USED FOR FUNCTIONAL ASSIGNMENT, AND GENES ARE ARRANGED INTO DIFFERENT CLASSES. SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT HAS BEEN WIDELY USED TO PROFILE METAGENOMIC SAMPLES AGAINST CURATED DATABASES. HOWEVER, THIS METHOD IS TIME CONSUMING AND REQUIRES HIGH COMPUTATIONAL RESOURCES. WHILE SEVERAL ALIGNMENT-FREE METHODS BASED ON K-MER COMPOSITION HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED IN RECENT YEARS, THEY STILL REQUIRE LARGE AMOUNTS OF COMPUTER MAIN MEMORY. IN THIS ARTICLE, METAMLP (METAGENOMICS MACHINE LEARNING PROFILER), A MACHINE LEARNING METHOD THAT REPRESENTS SEQUENCES AS NUMERICAL VECTORS (EMBEDDINGS) AND USES A SIMPLE ONE HIDDEN LAYER NEURAL NETWORK TO PROFILE FUNCTIONAL CATEGORIES, IS DEVELOPED. UNLIKE OTHER METHODS, METAMLP ENABLES PARTIAL MATCHING BY USING A REDUCED ALPHABET TO BUILD SEQUENCE EMBEDDINGS FROM FULL AND PARTIAL K-MERS. METAMLP IS ABLE TO IDENTIFY A SLIGHTLY LARGER NUMBER OF READS COMPARED WITH DIAMOND (ONE OF THE FASTEST SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT METHODS), AS WELL AS TO PERFORM ACCURATE PREDICTIONS WITH 0.99 PRECISION AND 0.99 RECALL. METAMLP CAN PROCESS 100M READS IN APPROXIMATELY 10 MINUTES ON A LAPTOP COMPUTER, WHICH IS 50 TIMES FASTER THAN DIAMOND.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
METAMT, A META LEARNING METHOD LEVERAGING MULTIPLE DOMAIN DATA FOR LOW RESOURCE MACHINE TRANSLATION. NEURAL MACHINE TRANSLATION (NMT) MODELS HAVE ACHIEVED STATE-OF-THE-ART TRANSLATION QUALITY WITH A LARGE QUANTITY OF PARALLEL CORPORA AVAILABLE. HOWEVER, THEIR PERFORMANCE SUFFERS SIGNIFICANTLY WHEN IT COMES TO DOMAIN-SPECIFIC TRANSLATIONS, IN WHICH TRAINING DATA ARE USUALLY SCARCE. IN THIS PAPER, WE PRESENT A NOVEL NMT MODEL WITH A NEW WORD EMBEDDING TRANSITION TECHNIQUE FOR FAST DOMAIN ADAPTION. WE PROPOSE TO SPLIT PARAMETERS IN THE MODEL INTO TWO GROUPS: MODEL PARAMETERS AND META PARAMETERS. THE FORMER ARE USED TO MODEL THE TRANSLATION WHILE THE LATTER ARE USED TO ADJUST THE REPRESENTATIONAL SPACE TO GENERALIZE THE MODEL TO DIFFERENT DOMAINS. WE MIMIC THE DOMAIN ADAPTATION OF THE MACHINE TRANSLATION MODEL TO LOW-RESOURCE DOMAINS USING MULTIPLE TRANSLATION TASKS ON DIFFERENT DOMAINS. A NEW TRAINING STRATEGY BASED ON META-LEARNING IS DEVELOPED ALONG WITH THE PROPOSED MODEL TO UPDATE THE MODEL PARAMETERS AND META PARAMETERS ALTERNATELY. EXPERIMENTS ON DATASETS OF DIFFERENT DOMAINS SHOWED SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENTS OF NMT PERFORMANCES ON A LIMITED AMOUNT OF DATA.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
MINI-REVIEW: RECENT ADVANCES IN POST-TRANSLATIONAL MODIFICATION SITE PREDICTION BASED ON DEEP LEARNING. POST-TRANSLATIONAL MODIFICATIONS (PTMS) ARE CLOSELY LINKED TO NUMEROUS DISEASES, PLAYING A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN REGULATING PROTEIN STRUCTURES, ACTIVITIES, AND FUNCTIONS. THEREFORE, THE IDENTIFICATION OF PTMS IS CRUCIAL FOR UNDERSTANDING THE MECHANISMS OF CELL BIOLOGY AND DISEASES THERAPY. COMPARED TO TRADITIONAL MACHINE LEARNING METHODS, THE DEEP LEARNING APPROACHES FOR PTM PREDICTION PROVIDE ACCURATE AND RAPID SCREENING, GUIDING THE DOWNSTREAM WET EXPERIMENTS TO LEVERAGE THE SCREENED INFORMATION FOR FOCUSED STUDIES. IN THIS PAPER, WE REVIEWED THE RECENT WORKS IN DEEP LEARNING TO IDENTIFY PHOSPHORYLATION, ACETYLATION, UBIQUITINATION, AND OTHER PTM TYPES. IN ADDITION, WE SUMMARIZED PTM DATABASES AND DISCUSSED FUTURE DIRECTIONS WITH CRITICAL INSIGHTS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
MINING E-CIGARETTE ADVERSE EVENTS IN SOCIAL MEDIA USING BI-LSTM RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORK WITH WORD EMBEDDING REPRESENTATION. OBJECTIVE: RECENT YEARS HAVE SEEN INCREASED WORLDWIDE POPULARITY OF E-CIGARETTE USE. HOWEVER, THE RISKS OF E-CIGARETTES ARE UNDEREXAMINED. MOST E-CIGARETTE ADVERSE EVENT STUDIES HAVE ACHIEVED LOW DETECTION RATES DUE TO LIMITED SUBJECT SAMPLE SIZES IN THE EXPERIMENTS AND SURVEYS. SOCIAL MEDIA PROVIDES A LARGE DATA REPOSITORY OF CONSUMERS' E-CIGARETTE FEEDBACK AND EXPERIENCES, WHICH ARE USEFUL FOR E-CIGARETTE SAFETY SURVEILLANCE. HOWEVER, IT IS DIFFICULT TO AUTOMATICALLY INTERPRET THE INFORMAL AND NONTECHNICAL CONSUMER VOCABULARY ABOUT E-CIGARETTES IN SOCIAL MEDIA. THIS ISSUE HINDERS THE USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA CONTENT FOR E-CIGARETTE SAFETY SURVEILLANCE. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN DEEP NEURAL NETWORK METHODS HAVE SHOWN PROMISE FOR NAMED ENTITY EXTRACTION FROM NOISY TEXT. MOTIVATED BY THESE OBSERVATIONS, WE AIMED TO DESIGN A DEEP NEURAL NETWORK APPROACH TO EXTRACT E-CIGARETTE SAFETY INFORMATION IN SOCIAL MEDIA. METHODS: OUR DEEP NEURAL LANGUAGE MODEL UTILIZES WORD EMBEDDING AS THE REPRESENTATION OF TEXT INPUT AND RECOGNIZES NAMED ENTITY TYPES WITH THE STATE-OF-THE-ART BIDIRECTIONAL LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY (BI-LSTM) RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORK. RESULTS: OUR BI-LSTM MODEL ACHIEVED THE BEST PERFORMANCE COMPARED TO 3 BASELINE MODELS, WITH A PRECISION OF 94.10%, A RECALL OF 91.80%, AND AN F-MEASURE OF 92.94%. WE IDENTIFIED 1591 UNIQUE ADVERSE EVENTS AND 9930 UNIQUE E-CIGARETTE COMPONENTS (IE, CHEMICALS, FLAVORS, AND DEVICES) FROM OUR RESEARCH TESTBED. CONCLUSION: ALTHOUGH THE CONDITIONAL RANDOM FIELD BASELINE MODEL HAD SLIGHTLY BETTER PRECISION THAN OUR APPROACH, OUR BI-LSTM MODEL ACHIEVED MUCH HIGHER RECALL, RESULTING IN THE BEST F-MEASURE. OUR METHOD CAN BE GENERALIZED TO EXTRACT MEDICAL CONCEPTS FROM SOCIAL MEDIA FOR OTHER MEDICAL APPLICATIONS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
MINING FALL-RELATED INFORMATION IN CLINICAL NOTES: COMPARISON OF RULE-BASED AND NOVEL WORD EMBEDDING-BASED MACHINE LEARNING APPROACHES. BACKGROUND: NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) OF HEALTH-RELATED DATA IS STILL AN EXPERTISE DEMANDING, AND RESOURCE EXPENSIVE PROCESS. WE CREATED A NOVEL, OPEN SOURCE RAPID CLINICAL TEXT MINING SYSTEM CALLED NIMBLEMINER. NIMBLEMINER COMBINES SEVERAL MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES (WORD EMBEDDING MODELS AND POSITIVE ONLY LABELS LEARNING) TO FACILITATE THE PROCESS IN WHICH A HUMAN RAPIDLY PERFORMS TEXT MINING OF CLINICAL NARRATIVES, WHILE BEING AIDED BY THE MACHINE LEARNING COMPONENTS. OBJECTIVE: THIS MANUSCRIPT DESCRIBES THE GENERAL SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE AND USER INTERFACE AND PRESENTS RESULTS OF A CASE STUDY AIMED AT CLASSIFYING FALL-RELATED INFORMATION (INCLUDING FALL HISTORY, FALL PREVENTION INTERVENTIONS, AND FALL RISK) IN HOMECARE VISIT NOTES. METHODS: WE EXTRACTED A CORPUS OF HOMECARE VISIT NOTES (N=1,149,586) FOR 89,459 PATIENTS FROM A LARGE US-BASED HOMECARE AGENCY. WE USED A GOLD STANDARD TESTING DATASET OF 750 NOTES ANNOTATED BY TWO HUMAN REVIEWERS TO COMPARE THE NIMBLEMINER'S ABILITY TO CLASSIFY DOCUMENTS REGARDING WHETHER THEY CONTAIN FALL-RELATED INFORMATION WITH A PREVIOUSLY DEVELOPED RULE-BASED NLP SYSTEM. RESULTS: NIMBLEMINER OUTPERFORMED THE RULE-BASED SYSTEM IN ALMOST ALL DOMAINS. THE OVERALL F- SCORE WAS 85.8% COMPARED TO 81% BY THE RULE BASED-SYSTEM WITH THE BEST PERFORMANCE FOR IDENTIFYING GENERAL FALL HISTORY (F=89% VS. F=85.1% RULE-BASED), FOLLOWED BY FALL RISK (F=87% VS. F=78.7% RULE-BASED), FALL PREVENTION INTERVENTIONS (F=88.1% VS. F=78.2% RULE-BASED) AND FALL WITHIN 2DAYS OF THE NOTE DATE (F=83.1% VS. F=80.6% RULE-BASED). THE RULE-BASED SYSTEM ACHIEVED SLIGHTLY BETTER PERFORMANCE FOR FALL WITHIN 2WEEKS OF THE NOTE DATE (F=81.9% VS. F=84% RULE-BASED). DISCUSSION & CONCLUSIONS: NIMBLEMINER OUTPERFORMED OTHER SYSTEMS AIMED AT FALL INFORMATION CLASSIFICATION, INCLUDING OUR PREVIOUSLY DEVELOPED RULE-BASED APPROACH. THESE PROMISING RESULTS INDICATE THAT CLINICAL TEXT MINING CAN BE IMPLEMENTED WITHOUT THE NEED FOR LARGE LABELED DATASETS NECESSARY FOR OTHER TYPES OF MACHINE LEARNING. THIS IS CRITICAL FOR DOMAINS WITH LITTLE NLP DEVELOPMENTS, LIKE NURSING OR ALLIED HEALTH PROFESSIONS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
MODEL-BASED REASONING OF CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE: REAL-WORLD METHODOLOGICAL STUDY OF ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS AND NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING METHODS. BACKGROUND: INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE IS A FORM OF MEDICINE THAT COMBINES PRACTICES AND TREATMENTS FROM ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE WITH CONVENTIONAL MEDICINE. THE DIAGNOSIS IN INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE INVOLVES THE CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS BASED ON MODERN MEDICINE AND SYNDROME PATTERN DIAGNOSIS. ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS (EMRS) ARE THE SYSTEMATIZED COLLECTION OF PATIENTS HEALTH INFORMATION STORED IN A DIGITAL FORMAT THAT CAN BE SHARED ACROSS DIFFERENT HEALTH CARE SETTINGS. ALTHOUGH SYNDROME AND SIGN INFORMATION OR RELATIVE INFORMATION CAN BE EXTRACTED FROM THE EMR AND CONTENT TEXTS CAN BE MAPPED TO COMPUTABILITY VECTORS USING NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING TECHNIQUES, APPLICATION OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TECHNIQUES TO SUPPORT PHYSICIANS IN MEDICAL PRACTICES REMAINS A MAJOR CHALLENGE. OBJECTIVE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE MODEL-BASED REASONING (MBR) ALGORITHMS FOR THE CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE BASED ON EMRS AND NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING. WE ALSO ESTIMATED THE ASSOCIATIONS AMONG THE FACTORS OF SAMPLE SIZE, NUMBER OF SYNDROME PATTERN TYPE, AND DIAGNOSIS IN MODERN MEDICINE USING THE MBR ALGORITHMS. METHODS: A TOTAL OF 14,075 MEDICAL RECORDS OF CLINICAL CASES WERE EXTRACTED FROM THE EMRS AS THE DEVELOPMENT DATA SET, AND AN EXTERNAL TEST DATA SET CONSISTING OF 1000 MEDICAL RECORDS OF CLINICAL CASES WAS EXTRACTED FROM INDEPENDENT EMRS. MBR METHODS BASED ON WORD EMBEDDING, MACHINE LEARNING, AND DEEP LEARNING ALGORITHMS WERE DEVELOPED FOR THE AUTOMATIC DIAGNOSIS OF SYNDROME PATTERN IN INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE. MBR ALGORITHMS COMBINING RULE-BASED REASONING (RBR) WERE ALSO DEVELOPED. A STANDARD EVALUATION METRICS CONSISTING OF ACCURACY, PRECISION, RECALL, AND F1 SCORE WAS USED FOR THE PERFORMANCE ESTIMATION OF THE METHODS. THE ASSOCIATION ANALYSES WERE CONDUCTED ON THE SAMPLE SIZE, NUMBER OF SYNDROME PATTERN TYPE, AND DIAGNOSIS OF LUNG DISEASES WITH THE BEST ALGORITHMS. RESULTS: THE WORD2VEC CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (CNN) MBR ALGORITHMS SHOWED HIGH PERFORMANCE (ACCURACY OF 0.9586 IN THE TEST DATA SET) IN THE SYNDROME PATTERN DIAGNOSIS OF LUNG DISEASES. THE WORD2VEC CNN MBR COMBINED WITH RBR ALSO SHOWED HIGH PERFORMANCE (ACCURACY OF 0.9229 IN THE TEST DATA SET). THE DIAGNOSIS OF LUNG DISEASES COULD ENHANCE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE WORD2VEC CNN MBR ALGORITHMS. EACH GROUP SAMPLE SIZE AND SYNDROME PATTERN TYPE AFFECTED THE PERFORMANCE OF THESE ALGORITHMS. CONCLUSIONS: THE MBR METHODS BASED ON WORD2VEC AND CNN SHOWED HIGH PERFORMANCE IN THE SYNDROME PATTERN DIAGNOSIS OF LUNG DISEASES IN INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE. THE PARAMETERS OF EACH GROUP'S SAMPLE SIZE, SYNDROME PATTERN TYPE, AND DIAGNOSIS OF LUNG DISEASES WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THE PERFORMANCE OF THE METHODS.

MULTI-LABEL EMOTION CLASSIFICATION OF URDU TWEETS. URDU IS A WIDELY USED LANGUAGE IN SOUTH ASIA AND WORLDWIDE. WHILE THERE ARE SIMILAR DATASETS AVAILABLE IN ENGLISH, WE CREATED THE FIRST MULTI-LABEL EMOTION DATASET CONSISTING OF 6,043 TWEETS AND SIX BASIC EMOTIONS IN THE URDU NASTALIQ SCRIPT. A MULTI-LABEL (ML) CLASSIFICATION APPROACH WAS ADOPTED TO DETECT EMOTIONS FROM URDU. THE MORPHOLOGICAL AND SYNTACTIC STRUCTURE OF URDU MAKES IT A CHALLENGING PROBLEM FOR MULTI-LABEL EMOTION DETECTION. IN THIS PAPER, WE BUILD A SET OF BASELINE CLASSIFIERS SUCH AS MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS (RANDOM FOREST (RF), DECISION TREE (J48), SEQUENTIAL MINIMAL OPTIMIZATION (SMO), ADABOOSTM1, AND BAGGING), DEEP-LEARNING ALGORITHMS (CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS (1D-CNN), LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY (LSTM), AND LSTM WITH CNN FEATURES) AND TRANSFORMER-BASED BASELINE (BERT). WE USED A COMBINATION OF TEXT REPRESENTATIONS: STYLOMETRIC-BASED FEATURES, PRE-TRAINED WORD EMBEDDING, WORD-BASED N-GRAMS, AND CHARACTER-BASED N-GRAMS. THE PAPER HIGHLIGHTS THE ANNOTATION GUIDELINES, DATASET CHARACTERISTICS AND INSIGHTS INTO DIFFERENT METHODOLOGIES USED FOR URDU BASED EMOTION CLASSIFICATION. WE PRESENT OUR BEST RESULTS USING MICRO-AVERAGED F1, MACRO-AVERAGED F1, ACCURACY, HAMMING LOSS (HL) AND EXACT MATCH (EM) FOR ALL TESTED METHODS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
MULTI-LABEL ZERO-SHOT LEARNING WITH GRAPH CONVOLUTIONAL NETWORKS. THE GOAL OF ZERO-SHOT LEARNING (ZSL) IS TO BUILD A CLASSIFIER THAT RECOGNIZES NOVEL CATEGORIES WITH NO CORRESPONDING ANNOTATED TRAINING DATA. THE TYPICAL ROUTINE IS TO TRANSFER KNOWLEDGE FROM SEEN CLASSES TO UNSEEN ONES BY LEARNING A VISUAL-SEMANTIC EMBEDDING. EXISTING MULTI-LABEL ZERO-SHOT LEARNING APPROACHES EITHER IGNORE CORRELATIONS AMONG LABELS, SUFFER FROM LARGE LABEL COMBINATIONS, OR LEARN THE EMBEDDING USING ONLY LOCAL OR GLOBAL VISUAL FEATURES. IN THIS PAPER, WE PROPOSE A GRAPH CONVOLUTION NETWORKS BASED MULTI-LABEL ZERO-SHOT LEARNING MODEL, ABBREVIATED AS MZSL-GCN. OUR MODEL FIRST CONSTRUCTS A LABEL RELATION GRAPH USING LABEL CO-OCCURRENCES AND COMPENSATES THE ABSENCE OF UNSEEN LABELS IN THE TRAINING PHASE BY SEMANTIC SIMILARITY. IT THEN TAKES THE GRAPH AND THE WORD EMBEDDING OF EACH SEEN (UNSEEN) LABEL AS INPUTS TO THE GCN TO LEARN THE LABEL SEMANTIC EMBEDDING, AND TO OBTAIN A SET OF INTER-DEPENDENT OBJECT CLASSIFIERS. MZSL-GCN SIMULTANEOUSLY TRAINS ANOTHER ATTENTION NETWORK TO LEARN COMPATIBLE LOCAL AND GLOBAL VISUAL FEATURES OF OBJECTS WITH RESPECT TO THE CLASSIFIERS, AND THUS MAKES THE WHOLE NETWORK END-TO-END TRAINABLE. IN ADDITION, THE USE OF UNLABELED TRAINING DATA CAN REDUCE THE BIAS TOWARD SEEN LABELS AND BOOST THE GENERALIZATION ABILITY. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS ON BENCHMARK DATASETS SHOW THAT OUR MZSL-GCN COMPETES WITH STATE-OF-THE-ART APPROACHES.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
MULTI-ONTOLOGY REFINED EMBEDDINGS (MORE): A HYBRID MULTI-ONTOLOGY AND CORPUS-BASED SEMANTIC REPRESENTATION MODEL FOR BIOMEDICAL CONCEPTS. OBJECTIVE: CURRENTLY, A MAJOR LIMITATION FOR NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) ANALYSES IN CLINICAL APPLICATIONS IS THAT CONCEPTS ARE NOT EFFECTIVELY REFERENCED IN VARIOUS FORMS ACROSS DIFFERENT TEXTS. THIS PAPER INTRODUCES MULTI-ONTOLOGY REFINED EMBEDDINGS (MORE), A NOVEL HYBRID FRAMEWORK THAT INCORPORATES DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE FROM MULTIPLE ONTOLOGIES INTO A DISTRIBUTIONAL SEMANTIC MODEL, LEARNED FROM A CORPUS OF CLINICAL TEXT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: WE USE THE RADCORE AND MIMIC-III FREE-TEXT DATASETS FOR THE CORPUS-BASED COMPONENT OF MORE. FOR THE ONTOLOGY-BASED PART, WE USE THE MEDICAL SUBJECT HEADINGS (MESH) ONTOLOGY AND THREE STATE-OF-THE-ART ONTOLOGY-BASED SIMILARITY MEASURES. IN OUR APPROACH, WE PROPOSE A NEW LEARNING OBJECTIVE, MODIFIED FROM THE SIGMOID CROSS-ENTROPY OBJECTIVE FUNCTION. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: WE USED TWO ESTABLISHED DATASETS OF SEMANTIC SIMILARITIES AMONG BIOMEDICAL CONCEPT PAIRS TO EVALUATE THE QUALITY OF THE GENERATED WORD EMBEDDINGS. ON THE FIRST DATASET WITH 29 CONCEPT PAIRS, WITH SIMILARITY SCORES ESTABLISHED BY PHYSICIANS AND MEDICAL CODERS, MORE'S SIMILARITY SCORES HAVE THE HIGHEST COMBINED CORRELATION (0.633), WHICH IS 5.0% HIGHER THAN THAT OF THE BASELINE MODEL, AND 12.4% HIGHER THAN THAT OF THE BEST ONTOLOGY-BASED SIMILARITY MEASURE. ON THE SECOND DATASET WITH 449 CONCEPT PAIRS, MORE'S SIMILARITY SCORES HAVE A CORRELATION OF 0.481, BASED ON THE AVERAGE OF FOUR MEDICAL RESIDENTS' SIMILARITY RATINGS, AND THAT OUTPERFORMS THE SKIP-GRAM MODEL BY 8.1%, AND THE BEST ONTOLOGY MEASURE BY 6.9%. FURTHERMORE, MORE OUTPERFORMS THREE PRE-TRAINED TRANSFORMER-BASED WORD EMBEDDING MODELS (I.E., BERT, CLINICALBERT, AND BIOBERT) ON BOTH DATASETS. CONCLUSION: MORE INCORPORATES KNOWLEDGE FROM SEVERAL BIOMEDICAL ONTOLOGIES INTO AN EXISTING CORPUS-BASED DISTRIBUTIONAL SEMANTICS MODEL, IMPROVING BOTH THE ACCURACY OF THE LEARNED WORD EMBEDDINGS AND THE EXTENSIBILITY OF THE MODEL TO A BROADER RANGE OF BIOMEDICAL CONCEPTS. MORE ALLOWS FOR MORE ACCURATE CLUSTERING OF CONCEPTS ACROSS A WIDE RANGE OF APPLICATIONS, SUCH AS ANALYZING PATIENT HEALTH RECORDS TO IDENTIFY SUBJECTS WITH SIMILAR PATHOLOGIES, OR INTEGRATING HETEROGENEOUS CLINICAL DATA TO IMPROVE INTEROPERABILITY BETWEEN HOSPITALS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
MULTIVIEW CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS FOR MULTIDOCUMENT EXTRACTIVE SUMMARIZATION. MULTIDOCUMENT SUMMARIZATION HAS GAINED POPULARITY IN MANY REAL WORLD APPLICATIONS BECAUSE VITAL INFORMATION CAN BE EXTRACTED WITHIN A SHORT TIME. EXTRACTIVE SUMMARIZATION AIMS TO GENERATE A SUMMARY OF A DOCUMENT OR A SET OF DOCUMENTS BY RANKING SENTENCES AND THE RANKING RESULTS RELY HEAVILY ON THE QUALITY OF SENTENCE FEATURES. HOWEVER, ALMOST ALL PREVIOUS ALGORITHMS REQUIRE HAND-CRAFTED FEATURES FOR SENTENCE REPRESENTATION. IN THIS PAPER, WE LEVERAGE ON WORD EMBEDDING TO REPRESENT SENTENCES SO AS TO AVOID THE INTENSIVE LABOR IN FEATURE ENGINEERING. AN ENHANCED CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS (CNNS) TERMED MULTIVIEW CNNS IS SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOPED TO OBTAIN THE FEATURES OF SENTENCES AND RANK SENTENCES JOINTLY. MULTIVIEW LEARNING IS INCORPORATED INTO THE MODEL TO GREATLY ENHANCE THE LEARNING CAPABILITY OF ORIGINAL CNN. WE EVALUATE THE GENERIC SUMMARIZATION PERFORMANCE OF OUR PROPOSED METHOD ON FIVE DOCUMENT UNDERSTANDING CONFERENCE DATASETS. THE PROPOSED SYSTEM OUTPERFORMS THE STATE-OF-THE-ART APPROACHES AND THE IMPROVEMENT IS STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT SHOWN BY PAIRED T -TEST.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
MULTIVIEW INCOMPLETE KNOWLEDGE GRAPH INTEGRATION WITH APPLICATION TO CROSS-INSTITUTIONAL EHR DATA HARMONIZATION. OBJECTIVE: THE GROWING AVAILABILITY OF ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS (EHR) DATA OPENS OPPORTUNITIES FOR INTEGRATIVE ANALYSIS OF MULTI-INSTITUTIONAL EHR TO PRODUCE GENERALIZABLE KNOWLEDGE. A KEY BARRIER TO SUCH INTEGRATIVE ANALYSES IS THE LACK OF SEMANTIC INTEROPERABILITY ACROSS DIFFERENT INSTITUTIONS DUE TO CODING DIFFERENCES. WE PROPOSE A MULTIVIEW INCOMPLETE KNOWLEDGE GRAPH INTEGRATION (MIKGI) ALGORITHM TO INTEGRATE INFORMATION FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES WITH PARTIALLY OVERLAPPING EHR CONCEPT CODES TO ENABLE TRANSLATIONS BETWEEN HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS. METHODS: THE MIKGI ALGORITHM COMBINES KNOWLEDGE GRAPH INFORMATION FROM (I) EMBEDDINGS TRAINED FROM THE CO-OCCURRENCE PATTERNS OF MEDICAL CODES WITHIN EACH EHR SYSTEM AND (II) SEMANTIC EMBEDDINGS OF THE TEXTUAL STRINGS OF ALL MEDICAL CODES OBTAINED FROM THE SELF-ALIGNING PRETRAINED BERT (SAPBERT) ALGORITHM. DUE TO THE HETEROGENEITY IN THE CODING ACROSS HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS, EACH EHR SOURCE PROVIDES PARTIAL COVERAGE OF THE AVAILABLE CODES. MIKGI SYNTHESIZES THE INCOMPLETE KNOWLEDGE GRAPHS DERIVED FROM THESE MULTI-SOURCE EMBEDDINGS BY MINIMIZING A SPHERICAL LOSS FUNCTION THAT COMBINES THE PAIRWISE DIRECTIONAL SIMILARITIES OF EMBEDDINGS COMPUTED FROM ALL AVAILABLE SOURCES. MIKGI OUTPUTS HARMONIZED SEMANTIC EMBEDDING VECTORS FOR ALL EHR CODES, WHICH IMPROVES THE QUALITY OF THE EMBEDDINGS AND ENABLES DIRECT ASSESSMENT OF BOTH SIMILARITY AND RELATEDNESS BETWEEN ANY PAIR OF CODES FROM MULTIPLE HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS. RESULTS: WITH EHR CO-OCCURRENCE DATA FROM VETERAN AFFAIRS (VA) HEALTHCARE AND MASS GENERAL BRIGHAM (MGB), MIKGI ALGORITHM PRODUCES HIGH QUALITY EMBEDDINGS FOR A VARIETY OF DOWNSTREAM TASKS INCLUDING DETECTING KNOWN SIMILAR OR RELATED ENTITY PAIRS AND MAPPING VA LOCAL CODES TO THE RELEVANT EHR CODES USED AT MGB. BASED ON THE COSINE SIMILARITY OF THE MIKGI TRAINED EMBEDDINGS, THE AUC WAS 0.918 FOR DETECTING SIMILAR ENTITY PAIRS AND 0.809 FOR DETECTING RELATED PAIRS. FOR CROSS-INSTITUTIONAL MEDICAL CODE MAPPING, THE TOP 1 AND TOP 5 ACCURACY WERE 91.0% AND 97.5% WHEN MAPPING MEDICATION CODES AT VA TO RXNORM MEDICATION CODES AT MGB; 59.1% AND 75.8% WHEN MAPPING VA LOCAL LABORATORY CODES TO LOINC HIERARCHY. WHEN TRAINED WITH 500 LABELS, THE LAB CODE MAPPING ATTAINED TOP 1 AND 5 ACCURACY AT 77.7% AND 87.9%. MIKGI ALSO ATTAINED BEST PERFORMANCE IN SELECTING VA LOCAL LAB CODES FOR DESIRED LABORATORY TESTS AND COVID-19 RELATED FEATURES FOR COVID EHR STUDIES. COMPARED TO EXISTING METHODS, MIKGI ATTAINED THE MOST ROBUST PERFORMANCE WITH ACCURACY THE HIGHEST OR NEAR THE HIGHEST ACROSS ALL TASKS. CONCLUSIONS: THE PROPOSED MIKGI ALGORITHM CAN EFFECTIVELY INTEGRATE INCOMPLETE SUMMARY DATA FROM BIOMEDICAL TEXT AND EHR DATA TO GENERATE HARMONIZED EMBEDDINGS FOR EHR CODES FOR KNOWLEDGE GRAPH MODELING AND CROSS-INSTITUTIONAL TRANSLATION OF EHR CODES.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
NALA: TEXT MINING NATURAL LANGUAGE MUTATION MENTIONS. MOTIVATION: THE EXTRACTION OF SEQUENCE VARIANTS FROM THE LITERATURE REMAINS AN IMPORTANT TASK. EXISTING METHODS PRIMARILY TARGET STANDARD (ST) MUTATION MENTIONS (E.G. 'E6V'), LEAVING RELEVANT MENTIONS NATURAL LANGUAGE (NL) LARGELY UNTAPPED (E.G. 'GLUTAMIC ACID WAS SUBSTITUTED BY VALINE AT RESIDUE 6'). RESULTS: WE INTRODUCED THREE NEW CORPORA SUGGESTING NAMED-ENTITY RECOGNITION (NER) TO BE MORE CHALLENGING THAN ANTICIPATED: 28-77% OF ALL ARTICLES CONTAINED MENTIONS ONLY AVAILABLE IN NL. OUR NEW METHOD NALA CAPTURED NL AND ST BY COMBINING CONDITIONAL RANDOM FIELDS WITH WORD EMBEDDING FEATURES LEARNED UNSUPERVISED FROM THE ENTIRE PUBMED. IN OUR HANDS, NALA SUBSTANTIALLY OUTPERFORMED THE STATE-OF-THE-ART. FOR INSTANCE, WE COMPARED ALL UNIQUE MENTIONS IN NEW DISCOVERIES CORRECTLY DETECTED BY ANY OF THREE METHODS (SETH, TMVAR, OR NALA ). NEITHER SETH NOR TMVAR DISCOVERED ANYTHING MISSED BY NALA , WHILE NALA UNIQUELY TAGGED 33% MENTIONS. FOR NL MENTIONS THE CORRESPONDING VALUE SHOT UP TO 100% NALA -ONLY.

IT HAS ATTRACTED MUCH ATTENTION BECAUSE OF ITS RELIABILITY. IN QUESTION ANSWERING SYSTEMS, BETTER REPRESENTATION OF WORDS IS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE, AND PROPER WORD EMBEDDING CAN SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE SYSTEM. WITH THE SUCCESS OF PRETRAINED MODELS IN GENERAL NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING TASKS, PRETRAINED MODELS HAVE BEEN WIDELY USED IN BIOMEDICAL AREAS, AND MANY PRETRAINED MODEL-BASED APPROACHES HAVE BEEN PROVEN EFFECTIVE IN BIOMEDICAL QUESTION-ANSWERING TASKS. IN ADDITION TO PROPER WORD EMBEDDING, NAME ENTITIES ALSO PROVIDE IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR BIOMEDICAL QUESTION ANSWERING. INSPIRED BY THE CONCEPT OF TRANSFER LEARNING, IN THIS STUDY, WE DEVELOPED A MECHANISM TO FINE-TUNE BIOBERT WITH A NAMED ENTITY DATASET TO IMPROVE THE QUESTION ANSWERING PERFORMANCE. FURTHERMORE, WE APPLIED BILSTM TO ENCODE THE QUESTION TEXT TO OBTAIN SENTENCE-LEVEL INFORMATION. TO BETTER COMBINE THE QUESTION LEVEL AND TOKEN LEVEL INFORMATION, WE USE BAGGING TO FURTHER IMPROVE THE OVERALL PERFORMANCE. THE PROPOSED FRAMEWORK WAS EVALUATED ON BIOASQ 6B AND 7B DATASETS, AND THE RESULTS HAVE SHOWN THAT OUR PROPOSED FRAMEWORK CAN OUTPERFORM ALL BASELINES.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING AND RECURRENT NETWORK MODELS FOR IDENTIFYING GENOMIC MUTATION-ASSOCIATED CANCER TREATMENT CHANGE FROM PATIENT PROGRESS NOTES. OBJECTIVES: NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) AND MACHINE LEARNING APPROACHES WERE USED TO BUILD CLASSIFIERS TO IDENTIFY GENOMIC-RELATED TREATMENT CHANGES IN THE FREE-TEXT VISIT PROGRESS NOTES OF CANCER PATIENTS. METHODS: WE OBTAINED 5889 DEIDENTIFIED PROGRESS REPORTS (2439 WORDS ON AVERAGE) FOR 755 CANCER PATIENTS WHO HAVE UNDERGONE A CLINICAL NEXT GENERATION SEQUENCING (NGS) TESTING IN WAKE FOREST BAPTIST COMPREHENSIVE CANCER CENTER FOR OUR DATA ANALYSES. AN NLP SYSTEM WAS IMPLEMENTED TO PROCESS THE FREE-TEXT DATA AND EXTRACT NGS-RELATED INFORMATION. THREE TYPES OF RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORK (RNN) NAMELY, GATED RECURRENT UNIT, LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY (LSTM), AND BIDIRECTIONAL LSTM (LSTM_BI) WERE APPLIED TO CLASSIFY DOCUMENTS TO THE TREATMENT-CHANGE AND NO-TREATMENT-CHANGE GROUPS. FURTHER, WE COMPARED THE PERFORMANCES OF RNNS TO 5 MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS INCLUDING NAIVE BAYES, K-NEAREST NEIGHBOR, SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE FOR CLASSIFICATION, RANDOM FOREST, AND LOGISTIC REGRESSION. RESULTS: OUR RESULTS SUGGESTED THAT, OVERALL, RNNS OUTPERFORMED TRADITIONAL MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS, AND LSTM_BI SHOWED THE BEST PERFORMANCE AMONG THE RNNS IN TERMS OF ACCURACY, PRECISION, RECALL, AND F1 SCORE. IN ADDITION, PRETRAINED WORD EMBEDDING CAN IMPROVE THE ACCURACY OF LSTM BY 3.4% AND REDUCE THE TRAINING TIME BY MORE THAN 60%. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: NLP AND RNN-BASED TEXT MINING SOLUTIONS HAVE DEMONSTRATED ADVANTAGES IN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL AND DOCUMENT CLASSIFICATION TASKS FOR UNSTRUCTURED CLINICAL PROGRESS NOTES.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
NATURAL LANGUAGE WORD EMBEDDINGS AS A GLIMPSE INTO HEALTHCARE LANGUAGE AND ASSOCIATED MORTALITY SURROUNDING END OF LIFE. OBJECTIVES: TO CLARIFY REAL-WORLD LINGUISTIC NUANCES AROUND DYING IN HOSPITAL AS WELL AS INACCURACY IN INDIVIDUAL-LEVEL PROGNOSTICATION TO SUPPORT ADVANCE CARE PLANNING AND PERSONALISED DISCUSSIONS ON LIMITATION OF LIFE SUSTAINING TREATMENT (LST). DESIGN: RETROSPECTIVE CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY OF REAL-WORLD CLINICAL DATA. SETTING: SECONDARY CARE, URBAN AND SUBURBAN TEACHING HOSPITALS. PARTICIPANTS: ALL INPATIENTS IN 12-MONTH PERIOD FROM 1 OCTOBER 2018 TO 30 SEPTEMBER 2019. METHODS: USING UNSUPERVISED NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING, WORD EMBEDDING IN LATENT SPACE WAS USED TO GENERATE PHRASE CLUSTERS WITH MOST SIMILAR SEMANTIC EMBEDDINGS TO 'CEILING OF TREATMENT' AND THEIR PROGNOSTICATION VALUE. RESULTS: WORD EMBEDDINGS WITH MOST SIMILARITY TO 'CEILING OF TREATMENT' CLUSTERED AROUND PHRASES DESCRIBING END-OF-LIFE CARE, CEILING OF CARE AND LST DISCUSSIONS. THE PHRASES HAVE DIFFERING PROGNOSTIC PROFILE WITH THE HIGHEST 7-DAY MORTALITY IN THE PHRASES MOST EXPLICITLY REFERRING TO END OF LIFE-'WITHDRAWAL OF CARE' (56.7%), 'TERMINAL CARE/END OF LIFE CARE' (57.5%) AND 'UN-SURVIVABLE' (57.6%). CONCLUSION: VOCABULARY USED AT END-OF-LIFE DISCUSSIONS ARE DIVERSE AND HAS A RANGE OF ASSOCIATIONS TO 7-DAY MORTALITY. THIS HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPORTANCE OF CORRECT APPLICATION OF TERMINOLOGY DURING LST AND END-OF-LIFE DISCUSSIONS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
NATURAL LANGUAGE-BASED MACHINE LEARNING MODELS FOR THE ANNOTATION OF CLINICAL RADIOLOGY REPORTS. PURPOSE TO COMPARE DIFFERENT METHODS FOR GENERATING FEATURES FROM RADIOLOGY REPORTS AND TO DEVELOP A METHOD TO AUTOMATICALLY IDENTIFY FINDINGS IN THESE REPORTS. MATERIALS AND METHODS IN THIS STUDY, 96 303 HEAD COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY (CT) REPORTS WERE OBTAINED. THE LINGUISTIC COMPLEXITY OF THESE REPORTS WAS COMPARED WITH THAT OF ALTERNATIVE CORPORA. HEAD CT REPORTS WERE PREPROCESSED, AND MACHINE-ANALYZABLE FEATURES WERE CONSTRUCTED BY USING BAG-OF-WORDS (BOW), WORD EMBEDDING, AND LATENT DIRICHLET ALLOCATION-BASED APPROACHES. ULTIMATELY, 1004 HEAD CT REPORTS WERE MANUALLY LABELED FOR FINDINGS OF INTEREST BY PHYSICIANS, AND A SUBSET OF THESE WERE DEEMED CRITICAL FINDINGS. LASSO LOGISTIC REGRESSION WAS USED TO TRAIN MODELS FOR PHYSICIAN-ASSIGNED LABELS ON 602 OF 1004 HEAD CT REPORTS (60%) USING THE CONSTRUCTED FEATURES, AND THE PERFORMANCE OF THESE MODELS WAS VALIDATED ON A HELD-OUT 402 OF 1004 REPORTS (40%). MODELS WERE SCORED BY AREA UNDER THE RECEIVER OPERATING CHARACTERISTIC CURVE (AUC), AND AGGREGATE AUC STATISTICS WERE REPORTED FOR (A) ALL LABELS, (B) CRITICAL LABELS, AND (C) THE PRESENCE OF ANY CRITICAL FINDING IN A REPORT. SENSITIVITY, SPECIFICITY, ACCURACY, AND F1 SCORE WERE REPORTED FOR THE BEST PERFORMING MODEL'S (A) PREDICTIONS OF ALL LABELS AND (B) IDENTIFICATION OF REPORTS CONTAINING CRITICAL FINDINGS. RESULTS THE BEST-PERFORMING MODEL (BOW WITH UNIGRAMS, BIGRAMS, AND TRIGRAMS PLUS AVERAGE WORD EMBEDDINGS VECTOR) HAD A HELD-OUT AUC OF 0.966 FOR IDENTIFYING THE PRESENCE OF ANY CRITICAL HEAD CT FINDING AND AN AVERAGE 0.957 AUC ACROSS ALL HEAD CT FINDINGS. SENSITIVITY AND SPECIFICITY FOR IDENTIFYING THE PRESENCE OF ANY CRITICAL FINDING WERE 92.59% (175 OF 189) AND 89.67% (191 OF 213), RESPECTIVELY. AVERAGE SENSITIVITY AND SPECIFICITY ACROSS ALL FINDINGS WERE 90.25% (1898 OF 2103) AND 91.72% (18 351 OF 20 007), RESPECTIVELY. SIMPLER BOW METHODS ACHIEVED RESULTS COMPETITIVE WITH THOSE OF MORE SOPHISTICATED APPROACHES, WITH AN AVERAGE AUC FOR PRESENCE OF ANY CRITICAL FINDING OF 0.951 FOR UNIGRAM BOW VERSUS 0.966 FOR THE BEST-PERFORMING MODEL. THE YULE I OF THE HEAD CT CORPUS WAS 34, MARKEDLY LOWER THAN THAT OF THE REUTERS CORPUS (AT 103) OR I2B2 DISCHARGE SUMMARIES (AT 271), INDICATING LOWER LINGUISTIC COMPLEXITY. CONCLUSION AUTOMATED METHODS CAN BE USED TO IDENTIFY FINDINGS IN RADIOLOGY REPORTS. THE SUCCESS OF THIS APPROACH BENEFITS FROM THE STANDARDIZED LANGUAGE OF THESE REPORTS. WITH THIS METHOD, A LARGE LABELED CORPUS CAN BE GENERATED FOR APPLICATIONS SUCH AS DEEP LEARNING.

NETWORK SENTIMENT ANALYSIS OF COLLEGE STUDENTS IN DIFFERENT EPIDEMIC STAGES BASED ON TEXT CLUSTERING. IN ORDER TO ANALYZE THE EVOLUTION TREND OF PUBLIC OPINION IN EMERGENCIES AND EXPLORE ITS EVOLUTION LAW, THIS PAPER CONSTRUCTS A NETWORK SENTIMENT ANALYSIS MODEL BASED ON TEXT CLUSTERING, WHERE THE EMOTION ANALYSIS PART IS BASED ON THE PRETRAINING BERT MODEL AND BIGRU MODEL, IN WHICH BERT IS USED AS THE WORD EMBEDDING MODEL TO EXTRACT THE FEATURE VECTOR OF EMOTIONAL TEXT AND BIGRU IS USED TO EXTRACT THE CONTEXT OF THE TEXT FEATURE VECTOR TO ACCURATELY IDENTIFY THE SENTIMENT POLARITY OF PUBLIC OPINION DATA. IN ADDITION, THE K-MEANS CLUSTERING ALGORITHM AND KOLMOGOROV-SMIRNOV Z TEST WERE USED TO DIVIDE THE DIFFERENT EPIDEMIC STAGES. COMPARED WITH OTHER METHODS, THE MODEL PROPOSED IN THIS PAPER HAS A GREAT DEGREE OF IMPROVEMENT IN ACCURACY, RECALL, AND F1 SCORE INDEX, WHICH PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY REFERENCE AND EFFECTIVE DETECTION MEANS FOR SCHOOLS AT ALL LEVELS TO CARRY OUT TIMELY MENTAL HEALTH EDUCATION AND PSYCHOLOGICAL INTERVENTION FOR STUDENTS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
NEURAL NETWORK ASSISTED PATHOLOGY CASE IDENTIFICATION. BACKGROUND: TRADITIONALLY, CASES FOR COHORT SELECTION AND QUALITY ASSURANCE PURPOSES ARE IDENTIFIED THROUGH STRUCTURED QUERY LANGUAGE (SQL) SEARCHES MATCHING SPECIFIC KEYWORDS. RECENTLY, SEVERAL NEURAL NETWORK-BASED NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) PIPELINES HAVE EMERGED AS AN ACCURATE ALTERNATIVE/COMPLEMENTARY METHOD FOR CASE RETRIEVAL. METHODS: THE DIAGNOSIS SECTION OF 1000 PATHOLOGY REPORTS WITH THE TERMS "COLON" AND "CARCINOMA" WERE RETRIEVED FROM OUR LABORATORY INFORMATION SYSTEM THROUGH A SQL QUERY. EACH OF THE REPORTS WERE LABELED AS EITHER POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE, WHERE CASES ARE CONSIDERED POSITIVE IF THE CASE WAS A PRIMARY ADENOCARCINOMA OF THE COLON. NEGATIVE CASES COMPRISED ADENOCARCINOMA FROM OTHER SITES, METASTATIC ADENOCARCINOMAS, BENIGN CONDITIONS, RECTAL CANCERS, AND OTHER CASES THAT DO NOT FIT IN THE PRIMARY COLONIC ADENOCARCINOMA CATEGORY. THE 1000 CASES WERE RANDOMLY SEPARATED INTO TRAINING, VALIDATION, AND HOLDOUT SETS. A CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (CNN) MODEL BUILT USING KERAS (A NEURAL NETWORK LIBRARY) WAS TRAINED TO IDENTIFY POSITIVE CASES, AND THE MODEL WAS APPLIED TO THE HOLDOUT SET TO PREDICT THE CATEGORY FOR EACH CASE. RESULTS: THE CNN MODEL CLASSIFIED 141 OUT OF 149 PRIMARY COLONIC ADENOCARCINOMA CASES, AND 43 OUT OF 51 NEGATIVE CASES CORRECTLY, ACHIEVING AN ACCURACY OF 92% AND AREA UNDER THE ROC CURVE (AUC) OF 0.957. CONCLUSION: TRAINED CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK MODELS BY ITSELF, OR AS AN ADJUNCT TO KEYWORD AND PATTERN-BASED TEXT EXTRACTION METHODS MAY BE USED TO SEARCH FOR PATHOLOGY CASES OF INTEREST WITH HIGH ACCURACY.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
NEURAL NETWORK-BASED APPROACHES FOR BIOMEDICAL RELATION CLASSIFICATION: A REVIEW. THE EXPLOSIVE GROWTH OF BIOMEDICAL LITERATURE HAS CREATED A RICH SOURCE OF KNOWLEDGE, SUCH AS THAT ON PROTEIN-PROTEIN INTERACTIONS (PPIS) AND DRUG-DRUG INTERACTIONS (DDIS), LOCKED IN UNSTRUCTURED FREE TEXT. BIOMEDICAL RELATION CLASSIFICATION AIMS TO AUTOMATICALLY DETECT AND CLASSIFY BIOMEDICAL RELATIONS, WHICH HAS GREAT BENEFITS FOR VARIOUS BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS. IN THE PAST DECADE, SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE IN BIOMEDICAL RELATION CLASSIFICATION. WITH THE ADVANCE OF NEURAL NETWORK METHODOLOGY, NEURAL NETWORK-BASED APPROACHES HAVE BEEN APPLIED IN BIOMEDICAL RELATION CLASSIFICATION AND ACHIEVED STATE-OF-THE-ART PERFORMANCE FOR SOME PUBLIC DATASETS AND SHARED TASKS. IN THIS REVIEW, WE DESCRIBE THE RECENT ADVANCEMENT OF NEURAL NETWORK-BASED APPROACHES FOR CLASSIFYING BIOMEDICAL RELATIONS. WE SUMMARIZE THE AVAILABLE CORPORA AND INTRODUCE EVALUATION METRICS. WE PRESENT THE GENERAL FRAMEWORK FOR NEURAL NETWORK-BASED APPROACHES IN BIOMEDICAL RELATION EXTRACTION AND PRETRAINED WORD EMBEDDING RESOURCES. WE DISCUSS NEURAL NETWORK-BASED APPROACHES, INCLUDING CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS (CNNS) AND RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORKS (RNNS). WE CONCLUDE BY DESCRIBING THE REMAINING CHALLENGES AND OUTLINING FUTURE DIRECTIONS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
NEURAL NETWORKS FOR MINING THE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN DISEASES AND SYMPTOMS IN CLINICAL NOTES. THERE ARE CHALLENGES FOR ANALYZING THE NARRATIVE CLINICAL NOTES IN ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS (EHRS) BECAUSE OF THEIR UNSTRUCTURED NATURE. MINING THE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN THE CLINICAL CONCEPTS WITHIN THE CLINICAL NOTES CAN SUPPORT PHYSICIANS IN MAKING DECISIONS, AND PROVIDE RESEARCHERS EVIDENCE ABOUT DISEASE DEVELOPMENT AND TREATMENT. IN THIS PAPER, IN ORDER TO MODEL AND ANALYZE DISEASE AND SYMPTOM RELATIONSHIPS IN THE CLINICAL NOTES, WE PRESENT A CONCEPT ASSOCIATION MINING FRAMEWORK THAT IS BASED ON WORD EMBEDDING LEARNED THROUGH NEURAL NETWORKS. THE APPROACH IS TESTED USING 154,738 CLINICAL NOTES FROM 500 PATIENTS, WHICH ARE EXTRACTED FROM THE INDIANA UNIVERSITY HEALTH'S ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS SYSTEM. ALL PATIENTS ARE DIAGNOSED WITH MORE THAN ONE TYPE OF DISEASE. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THIS CONCEPT ASSOCIATION MINING FRAMEWORK CAN IDENTIFY RELATED DISEASES AND SYMPTOMS. WE ALSO PROPOSE A METHOD TO VISUALIZE A PATIENTS' DISEASES AND RELATED SYMPTOMS IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER. THIS VISUALIZATION CAN PROVIDE PHYSICIANS AN OVERVIEW OF THE MEDICAL HISTORY OF A PATIENT AND SUPPORT DECISION MAKING. THE PRESENTED APPROACH CAN ALSO BE EXPANDED TO ANALYZE THE ASSOCIATIONS OF OTHER CLINICAL CONCEPTS, SUCH AS SOCIAL HISTORY, FAMILY HISTORY, MEDICATIONS, ETC.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
NEURAL NETWORKS WITH EMOTION ASSOCIATIONS, TOPIC MODELING AND SUPERVISED TERM WEIGHTING FOR SENTIMENT ANALYSIS. AUTOMATED SENTIMENT ANALYSIS IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY RECOGNIZED DUE TO THE GROWING IMPORTANCE OF SOCIAL MEDIA AND E-COMMERCE PLATFORM REVIEW WEBSITES. DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS OUTPERFORM TRADITIONAL LEXICON-BASED AND MACHINE LEARNING METHODS BY EFFECTIVELY EXPLOITING CONTEXTUAL WORD EMBEDDINGS TO GENERATE DENSE DOCUMENT REPRESENTATION. HOWEVER, THIS REPRESENTATION MODEL IS NOT FULLY ADEQUATE TO CAPTURE TOPICAL SEMANTICS AND THE SENTIMENT POLARITY OF WORDS. TO OVERCOME THESE PROBLEMS, A NOVEL SENTIMENT ANALYSIS MODEL IS PROPOSED THAT UTILIZES RICHER DOCUMENT REPRESENTATIONS OF WORD-EMOTION ASSOCIATIONS AND TOPIC MODELS, WHICH IS THE MAIN COMPUTATIONAL NOVELTY OF THIS STUDY. THE SENTIMENT ANALYSIS MODEL INTEGRATES WORD EMBEDDINGS WITH LEXICON-BASED SENTIMENT AND EMOTION INDICATORS, INCLUDING NEGATIONS AND EMOTICONS, AND TO FURTHER IMPROVE ITS PERFORMANCE, A TOPIC MODELING COMPONENT IS UTILIZED TOGETHER WITH A BAG-OF-WORDS MODEL BASED ON A SUPERVISED TERM WEIGHTING SCHEME. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROPOSED MODEL IS EVALUATED USING LARGE DATASETS OF AMAZON PRODUCT REVIEWS AND HOTEL REVIEWS. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS PROVE THAT THE PROPOSED DOCUMENT REPRESENTATION IS VALID FOR THE SENTIMENT ANALYSIS OF PRODUCT AND HOTEL REVIEWS, IRRESPECTIVE OF THEIR CLASS IMBALANCE. THE RESULTS ALSO SHOW THAT THE PROPOSED MODEL IMPROVES ON EXISTING MACHINE LEARNING METHODS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
NIMBLEMINER: AN OPEN-SOURCE NURSING-SENSITIVE NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING SYSTEM BASED ON WORD EMBEDDING. THIS STUDY DEVELOPS AND EVALUATES AN OPEN-SOURCE SOFTWARE (CALLED NIMBLEMINER) THAT ALLOWS CLINICIANS TO INTERACT WITH WORD EMBEDDING MODELS WITH A GOAL OF CREATING LEXICONS OF SIMILAR TERMS. AS A CASE STUDY, THE SYSTEM WAS USED TO IDENTIFY SIMILAR TERMS FOR PATIENT FALL HISTORY FROM HOMECARE VISIT NOTES (N = 1 149 586) EXTRACTED FROM A LARGE US HOMECARE AGENCY. SEVERAL EXPERIMENTS WITH PARAMETERS OF WORD EMBEDDING MODELS WERE CONDUCTED TO IDENTIFY THE MOST TIME-EFFECTIVE AND HIGH-QUALITY MODEL. MODELS WITH LARGER WORD WINDOW WIDTH SIZES (N = 10) THAT PRESENT USERS WITH ABOUT 50 TOP POTENTIALLY SIMILAR TERMS FOR EACH (TRUE) TERM VALIDATED BY THE USER WERE MOST EFFECTIVE. NIMBLEMINER CAN ASSIST IN BUILDING A THOROUGH VOCABULARY OF FALL HISTORY TERMS IN ABOUT 2 HOURS.

THIS PAPER AIMS AT ANALYZING THE CHANGES IN THE FIELDS OF SPEECH AND NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING OVER THE RECENT PAST 5 YEARS (2016-2020). IT IS IN CONTINUATION OF A SERIES OF TWO PAPERS THAT WE PUBLISHED IN 2019 ON THE ANALYSIS OF THE NLP4NLP CORPUS, WHICH CONTAINED ARTICLES PUBLISHED IN 34 MAJOR CONFERENCES AND JOURNALS IN THE FIELD OF SPEECH AND NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING, OVER A PERIOD OF 50 YEARS (1965-2015), AND ANALYZED WITH THE METHODS DEVELOPED IN THE FIELD OF NLP, HENCE ITS NAME. THE EXTENDED NLP4NLP+5 CORPUS NOW COVERS 55 YEARS, COMPRISING CLOSE TO 90,000 DOCUMENTS [+30% COMPARED WITH NLP4NLP: AS MANY ARTICLES HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED IN THE SINGLE YEAR 2020 THAN OVER THE FIRST 25 YEARS (1965-1989)], 67,000 AUTHORS (+40%), 590,000 REFERENCES (+80%), AND APPROXIMATELY 380 MILLION WORDS (+40%). THESE ANALYSES ARE CONDUCTED GLOBALLY OR COMPARATIVELY AMONG SOURCES AND ALSO WITH THE GENERAL SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE, WITH A FOCUS ON THE PAST 5 YEARS. IT CONCLUDES IN IDENTIFYING PROFOUND CHANGES IN RESEARCH TOPICS AS WELL AS IN THE EMERGENCE OF A NEW GENERATION OF AUTHORS AND THE APPEARANCE OF NEW PUBLICATIONS AROUND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, NEURAL NETWORKS, MACHINE LEARNING, AND WORD EMBEDDING.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
OBJECT ACTIVITY SCENE DESCRIPTION, CONSTRUCTION, AND RECOGNITION. ACTION RECOGNITION IS A CRITICAL TASK FOR SOCIAL ROBOTS TO MEANINGFULLY ENGAGE WITH THEIR ENVIRONMENT. 3-D HUMAN SKELETON-BASED ACTION RECOGNITION HAS BEEN AN ATTRACTIVE RESEARCH AREA IN RECENT YEARS. ALTHOUGH THE EXISTING APPROACHES ARE GOOD AT ACTION RECOGNITION, IT IS A GREAT CHALLENGE TO RECOGNIZE A GROUP OF ACTIONS IN AN ACTIVITY SCENE. TO TACKLE THIS PROBLEM, AT FIRST, WE PARTITION THE SCENE INTO SEVERAL PRIMITIVE ACTIONS (PAS)-BASED UPON MOTION ATTENTION MECHANISM. THEN, THE PAS ARE DESCRIBED BY THE TRAJECTORY VECTORS OF THE CORRESPONDING JOINTS. AFTER THAT, MOTIVATED BY TEXT CLASSIFICATION BASED ON WORD EMBEDDING, WE EMPLOY A CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (CNN) TO RECOGNIZE ACTIVITY SCENES BY CONSIDERING MOTION OF JOINTS AS "WORD" OF ACTIVITY. THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS ON THE DATASET OF HUMAN ACTIVITY SCENES SHOW THE EFFICIENCY OF THE PROPOSED APPROACH.

IN THIS WORK WE PRESENT A SYSTEMATIC EMPIRICAL STUDY FOCUSED ON THE SUITABILITY OF THE STATE-OF-THE-ART MULTILINGUAL ENCODERS FOR CROSS-LINGUAL DOCUMENT AND SENTENCE RETRIEVAL TASKS ACROSS A NUMBER OF DIVERSE LANGUAGE PAIRS. WE FIRST TREAT THESE MODELS AS MULTILINGUAL TEXT ENCODERS AND BENCHMARK THEIR PERFORMANCE IN UNSUPERVISED AD-HOC SENTENCE- AND DOCUMENT-LEVEL CLIR. IN CONTRAST TO SUPERVISED LANGUAGE UNDERSTANDING, OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT FOR UNSUPERVISED DOCUMENT-LEVEL CLIR-A SETUP WITH NO RELEVANCE JUDGMENTS FOR IR-SPECIFIC FINE-TUNING-PRETRAINED MULTILINGUAL ENCODERS ON AVERAGE FAIL TO SIGNIFICANTLY OUTPERFORM EARLIER MODELS BASED ON CLWES. FOR SENTENCE-LEVEL RETRIEVAL, WE DO OBTAIN STATE-OF-THE-ART PERFORMANCE: THE PEAK SCORES, HOWEVER, ARE MET BY MULTILINGUAL ENCODERS THAT HAVE BEEN FURTHER SPECIALIZED, IN A SUPERVISED FASHION, FOR SENTENCE UNDERSTANDING TASKS, RATHER THAN USING THEIR VANILLA 'OFF-THE-SHELF' VARIANTS. FOLLOWING THESE RESULTS, WE INTRODUCE LOCALIZED RELEVANCE MATCHING FOR DOCUMENT-LEVEL CLIR, WHERE WE INDEPENDENTLY SCORE A QUERY AGAINST DOCUMENT SECTIONS. IN THE SECOND PART, WE EVALUATE MULTILINGUAL ENCODERS FINE-TUNED IN A SUPERVISED FASHION (I.E., WE LEARN TO RANK) ON ENGLISH RELEVANCE DATA IN A SERIES OF ZERO-SHOT LANGUAGE AND DOMAIN TRANSFER CLIR EXPERIMENTS. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT, DESPITE THE SUPERVISION, AND DUE TO THE DOMAIN AND LANGUAGE SHIFT, SUPERVISED RE-RANKING RARELY IMPROVES THE PERFORMANCE OF MULTILINGUAL TRANSFORMERS AS UNSUPERVISED BASE RANKERS. FINALLY, ONLY WITH IN-DOMAIN CONTRASTIVE FINE-TUNING (I.E., SAME DOMAIN, ONLY LANGUAGE TRANSFER), WE MANAGE TO IMPROVE THE RANKING QUALITY. WE UNCOVER SUBSTANTIAL EMPIRICAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CROSS-LINGUAL RETRIEVAL RESULTS AND RESULTS OF (ZERO-SHOT) CROSS-LINGUAL TRANSFER FOR MONOLINGUAL RETRIEVAL IN TARGET LANGUAGES, WHICH POINT TO "MONOLINGUAL OVERFITTING" OF RETRIEVAL MODELS TRAINED ON MONOLINGUAL (ENGLISH) DATA, EVEN IF THEY ARE BASED ON MULTILINGUAL TRANSFORMERS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
ON THE UNSUPERVISED ANALYSIS OF DOMAIN-SPECIFIC CHINESE TEXTS. WITH THE GROWING AVAILABILITY OF DIGITIZED TEXT DATA BOTH PUBLICLY AND PRIVATELY, THERE IS A GREAT NEED FOR EFFECTIVE COMPUTATIONAL TOOLS TO AUTOMATICALLY EXTRACT INFORMATION FROM TEXTS. BECAUSE THE CHINESE LANGUAGE DIFFERS MOST SIGNIFICANTLY FROM ALPHABET-BASED LANGUAGES IN NOT SPECIFYING WORD BOUNDARIES, MOST EXISTING CHINESE TEXT-MINING METHODS REQUIRE A PRESPECIFIED VOCABULARY AND/OR A LARGE RELEVANT TRAINING CORPUS, WHICH MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN SOME APPLICATIONS. WE INTRODUCE AN UNSUPERVISED METHOD, TOP-DOWN WORD DISCOVERY AND SEGMENTATION (TOPWORDS), FOR SIMULTANEOUSLY DISCOVERING AND SEGMENTING WORDS AND PHRASES FROM LARGE VOLUMES OF UNSTRUCTURED CHINESE TEXTS, AND PROPOSE WAYS TO ORDER DISCOVERED WORDS AND CONDUCT HIGHER-LEVEL CONTEXT ANALYSES. TOPWORDS IS PARTICULARLY USEFUL FOR MINING ONLINE AND DOMAIN-SPECIFIC TEXTS WHERE THE UNDERLYING VOCABULARY IS UNKNOWN OR THE TEXTS OF INTEREST DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM AVAILABLE TRAINING CORPORA. WHEN OUTPUTS FROM TOPWORDS ARE FED INTO CONTEXT ANALYSIS TOOLS SUCH AS TOPIC MODELING, WORD EMBEDDING, AND ASSOCIATION PATTERN FINDING, THE RESULTS ARE AS GOOD AS OR BETTER THAN THAT FROM USING OUTPUTS OF A SUPERVISED SEGMENTATION METHOD.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
ONTOLOGY-BASED HEALTHCARE NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION FROM TWITTER MESSAGES USING A RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORK APPROACH. NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION (NER) IN THE HEALTHCARE DOMAIN INVOLVES IDENTIFYING AND CATEGORIZING DISEASE, DRUGS, AND SYMPTOMS FOR BIOSURVEILLANCE, EXTRACTING THEIR RELATED PROPERTIES AND ACTIVITIES, AND IDENTIFYING ADVERSE DRUG EVENTS APPEARING IN TEXTS. THESE TASKS ARE IMPORTANT CHALLENGES IN HEALTHCARE. ANALYZING USER MESSAGES IN SOCIAL MEDIA NETWORKS SUCH AS TWITTER CAN PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES TO DETECT AND MANAGE PUBLIC HEALTH EVENTS. TWITTER PROVIDES A BROAD RANGE OF SHORT MESSAGES THAT CONTAIN INTERESTING INFORMATION FOR INFORMATION EXTRACTION. IN THIS PAPER, WE PRESENT A HEALTH-RELATED NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION (HNER) TASK USING HEALTHCARE-DOMAIN ONTOLOGY THAT CAN RECOGNIZE HEALTH-RELATED ENTITIES FROM LARGE NUMBERS OF USER MESSAGES FROM TWITTER. FOR THIS TASK, WE EMPLOY A DEEP LEARNING ARCHITECTURE WHICH IS BASED ON A RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORK (RNN) WITH LITTLE FEATURE ENGINEERING. TO ACHIEVE OUR GOAL, WE COLLECTED A LARGE NUMBER OF TWITTER MESSAGES CONTAINING HEALTH-RELATED INFORMATION, AND DETECTED BIOMEDICAL ENTITIES FROM THE UNIFIED MEDICAL LANGUAGE SYSTEM (UMLS). A BIDIRECTIONAL LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY (BILSTM) MODEL LEARNED RICH CONTEXT INFORMATION, AND A CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (CNN) WAS USED TO PRODUCE CHARACTER-LEVEL FEATURES. THE CONDITIONAL RANDOM FIELD (CRF) MODEL PREDICTED A SEQUENCE OF LABELS THAT CORRESPONDED TO A SEQUENCE OF INPUTS, AND THE VITERBI ALGORITHM WAS USED TO DETECT HEALTH-RELATED ENTITIES FROM TWITTER MESSAGES. WE PROVIDE COMPREHENSIVE RESULTS GIVING VALUABLE INSIGHTS FOR IDENTIFYING MEDICAL ENTITIES IN TWITTER FOR VARIOUS APPLICATIONS. THE BILSTM-CRF MODEL ACHIEVED A PRECISION OF 93.99%, RECALL OF 73.31%, AND F1-SCORE OF 81.77% FOR DISEASE OR SYNDROME HNER; A PRECISION OF 90.83%, RECALL OF 81.98%, AND F1-SCORE OF 87.52% FOR SIGN OR SYMPTOM HNER; AND A PRECISION OF 94.85%, RECALL OF 73.47%, AND F1-SCORE OF 84.51% FOR PHARMACOLOGIC SUBSTANCE NAMED ENTITIES. THE ONTOLOGY-BASED MANUAL ANNOTATION RESULTS SHOW THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO PERFORM HIGH-QUALITY ANNOTATION DESPITE THE COMPLEXITY OF MEDICAL TERMINOLOGY AND THE LACK OF CONTEXT IN TWEETS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
ONTOLOGY-BASED VENOUS THROMBOEMBOLISM RISK ASSESSMENT MODEL DEVELOPING FROM MEDICAL RECORDS. BACKGROUND: PADUA LINEAR MODEL IS WIDELY USED FOR THE RISK ASSESSMENT OF VENOUS THROMBOEMBOLISM (VTE), A COMMON BUT PREVENTABLE COMPLICATION FOR INPATIENTS. HOWEVER, GENETIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN WESTERN AND CHINESE POPULATION LIMIT THE VALIDITY OF PADUA MODEL IN CHINESE PATIENTS. MEDICAL RECORDS WHICH CONTAIN RICH INFORMATION ABOUT DISEASE PROGRESSION, ARE USEFUL IN MINING NEW RISK FACTORS RELATED TO CHINESE VTE PATIENTS. FURTHERMORE, MACHINE LEARNING (ML) METHODS PROVIDE NEW OPPORTUNITIES TO BUILD PRECISE RISK PREDICTION MODEL BY AUTOMATIC SELECTION OF RISK FACTORS BASED ON ORIGINAL MEDICAL RECORDS. METHODS: MEDICAL RECORDS OF 3,106 INPATIENTS INCLUDING 224 VTE PATIENTS WERE COLLECTED AND VARIOUS TYPES OF ONTOLOGIES WERE INTEGRATED TO PARSE UNSTRUCTURED TEXT. A WORKFLOW OF ONTOLOGY-BASED VTE RISK PREDICTION MODEL, THAT COMBINES NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) AND MACHINE LEARNING (ML) TECHNOLOGIES, WAS PROPOSED. FIRSTLY ONTOLOGY TERMS WERE EXTRACTED FROM MEDICAL RECORDS, THEN SORTED ACCORDING TO THEIR CALCULATED WEIGHTS. NEXT IMPORTANCE OF EACH TERM IN THE UNIT OF SECTION WAS EVALUATED AND FINALLY A ML MODEL WAS BUILT BASED ON A SUBSET OF TERMS. FOUR ML METHODS WERE TESTED, AND THE BEST MODEL WAS DECIDED BY COMPARING AREA UNDER THE RECEIVER OPERATING CHARACTERISTIC CURVE (AUROC). RESULTS: MEDICAL RECORDS WERE FIRST SPLIT INTO DIFFERENT SECTIONS AND SUBSEQUENTLY, TERMS FROM EACH SECTION WERE SORTED BY THEIR WEIGHTS CALCULATED BY MULTIPLE TYPES OF INFORMATION. GREEDY SELECTION ALGORITHM WAS USED TO OBTAIN SIGNIFICANT SECTIONS AND TERMS. TOP TERMS IN EACH SECTION WERE SELECTED TO CONSTRUCT PATIENTS' DISTRIBUTED REPRESENTATIONS BY WORD EMBEDDING TECHNIQUE. USING TOP 300 TERMS OF TWO IMPORTANT SECTIONS, NAMELY THE 'PROGRESS NOTE' SECTION AND 'ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS' SECTION, THE MODEL SHOWED RELATIVELY BETTER PREDICTIVE PERFORMANCE. THEN ML MODEL WHICH UTILIZES A SUBSET OF TERMS FROM TWO SECTIONS, ABOUT 110 TERMS, ACHIEVED THE BEST AUC SCORE, OF 0.973 +/- 0.006, WHICH WAS SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER COMPARED TO THE PADUA'S PERFORMANCE OF 0.791 +/- 0.022. TERMS FOUND BY THE MODEL SHOWED THEIR POTENTIAL TO HELP CLINICIANS EXPLORE NEW RISK FACTORS. CONCLUSIONS: IN THIS STUDY, A NEW VTE RISK ASSESSMENT MODEL BASED ON ONTOLOGIES EXTRACTION FROM RAW MEDICAL RECORDS IS DEVELOPED AND ITS PERFORMANCE IS VERIFIED ON REAL CLINICAL DATASET. RESULTS OF SELECTED TERMS CAN HELP CLINICIANS TO DISCOVER MEANINGFUL RISK FACTORS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
OPTIMIZING CORPUS CREATION FOR TRAINING WORD EMBEDDING IN LOW RESOURCE DOMAINS: A CASE STUDY IN AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER (ASD). AUTOMATING THE EXTRACTION OF BEHAVIORAL CRITERIA INDICATIVE OF AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER (ASD) IN ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS (EHRS) CAN CONTRIBUTE SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE EFFORT TO MONITOR THE CONDITION. WORD EMBEDDING ALGORITHMS SUCH AS WORD2VEC CAN ENCODE SEMANTIC MEANINGS OF WORDS IN VECTORS AND ASSIST IN AUTOMATED VOCABULARY DISCOVERY FROM EHRS. HOWEVER, TEXT AVAILABLE FOR TRAINING WORD EMBEDDINGS FOR ASD IS MINISCULE COMPARED TO THE BILLIONS OF TOKENS TYPICALLY USED. WE EVALUATE THE IMPORTANCE OF CORPUS SPECIFICITY VERSUS SIZE AND HYPOTHESIZE THAT FOR SPECIFIC DOMAINS SMALL CORPORA CAN GENERATE EXCELLENT WORD EMBEDDINGS. WE CUSTOM-BUILT 6 ASD-THEMED CORPORA (N=4482), USING ASD EHRS AND ABSTRACTS FROM PUBMED (N=39K) AND PSYCHINFO (N=69K) AND EVALUATED THEM. WE WERE ABLE TO GENERATE THE MOST USEFUL 200-DIMENSION EMBEDDINGS BASED ON THE SMALL ASD EHR DATA. DUE TO DIVERSITY IN ITS VOCABULARY, THE ABSTRACT-BASED EMBEDDINGS GENERATED FEWER RELATED TERMS AND SAW MINIMAL IMPROVEMENT WHEN THE SIZE OF THE CORPUS INCREASED.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
OUTCOME PREDICTION FROM BEHAVIOUR CHANGE INTERVENTION EVALUATIONS USING A COMBINATION OF NODE AND WORD EMBEDDING. FINDINGS FROM RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) OF BEHAVIOUR CHANGE INTERVENTIONS ENCODE MUCH OF OUR KNOWLEDGE ON INTERVENTION EFFICACY UNDER DEFINED CONDITIONS. PREDICTING OUTCOMES OF NOVEL INTERVENTIONS IN NOVEL CONDITIONS CAN BE CHALLENGING, AS CAN PREDICTING DIFFERENCES IN OUTCOMES BETWEEN DIFFERENT INTERVENTIONS OR DIFFERENT CONDITIONS. TO PREDICT OUTCOMES FROM RCTS, WE PROPOSE A GENERIC FRAMEWORK OF COMBINING THE INFORMATION FROM TWO SOURCES - I) THE INSTANCES (COMPRISED OF SURROUNDING TEXT AND THEIR NUMERIC VALUES) OF RELEVANT ATTRIBUTES, NAMELY THE INTERVENTION, SETTING AND POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS OF A STUDY, AND II) ABSTRACT REPRESENTATION OF THE CATEGORIES OF THESE ATTRIBUTES THEMSELVES. WE DEMONSTRATE THAT THIS WAY OF ENCODING BOTH THE INFORMATION ABOUT AN ATTRIBUTE AND ITS VALUE WHEN USED AS AN EMBEDDING LAYER WITHIN A STANDARD DEEP SEQUENCE MODELING SETUP IMPROVES THE OUTCOME PREDICTION EFFECTIVENESS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
PART-OF-SPEECH TAGGING ENHANCEMENT TO NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING FOR THAI WH-QUESTION CLASSIFICATION WITH DEEP LEARNING. QUESTION CLASSIFICATION IS A CRUCIAL TASK FOR ANSWER SELECTION. QUESTION CLASSIFICATION COULD HELP DEFINE THE STRUCTURE OF QUESTION SENTENCES GENERATED BY FEATURES EXTRACTION FROM A SENTENCE, SUCH AS WHO, WHEN, WHERE, AND HOW. IN THIS PAPER, WE PROPOSED A METHODOLOGY TO IMPROVE QUESTION CLASSIFICATION FROM TEXTS BY USING FEATURE SELECTION AND WORD EMBEDDING TECHNIQUES. WE CONDUCTED SEVERAL EXPERIMENTS TO EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE PROPOSED METHODOLOGY USING TWO DIFFERENT DATASETS (TREC-6 DATASET AND THAI SENTENCE DATASET) WITH TERM FREQUENCY AND COMBINED TERM FREQUENCY-INVERSE DOCUMENT FREQUENCY INCLUDING UNIGRAM, UNIGRAM+BIGRAM, AND UNIGRAM + TRIGRAM AS FEATURES. MACHINE LEARNING MODELS BASED ON TRADITIONAL AND DEEP LEARNING CLASSIFIERS WERE USED. THE TRADITIONAL CLASSIFICATION MODELS WERE MULTINOMIAL NAIVE BAYES, LOGISTIC REGRESSION, AND SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE. THE DEEP LEARNING TECHNIQUES WERE BIDIRECTIONAL LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY (BILSTM), CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS (CNN), AND HYBRID MODEL, WHICH COMBINED CNN AND BILSTM MODEL. THE EXPERIMENT RESULTS SHOWED THAT OUR METHODOLOGY BASED ON PART-OF-SPEECH (POS) TAGGING WAS THE BEST TO IMPROVE QUESTION CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY. THE CLASSIFYING QUESTION CATEGORIES ACHIEVED WITH AVERAGE MICRO F 1 -SCORE OF 0.98 WHEN APPLIED SVM MODEL ON ADDING ALL POS TAGS IN THE TREC-6 DATASET. THE HIGHEST AVERAGE MICRO F 1 -SCORE ACHIEVED 0.8 WHEN APPLIED GLOVE BY USING CNN MODEL ON ADDING FOCUSING TAGS IN THE THAI SENTENCES DATASET.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
PATTERNS OF ROUTES OF ADMINISTRATION AND DRUG TAMPERING FOR NONMEDICAL OPIOID CONSUMPTION: DATA MINING AND CONTENT ANALYSIS OF REDDIT DISCUSSIONS. BACKGROUND: THE COMPLEX UNFOLDING OF THE US OPIOID EPIDEMIC IN THE LAST 20 YEARS HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF A LARGE BODY OF MEDICAL AND PHARMACOLOGICAL RESEARCH, AND IT HAS SPARKED A MULTIDISCIPLINARY DISCUSSION ON HOW TO IMPLEMENT INTERVENTIONS AND POLICIES TO EFFECTIVELY CONTROL ITS IMPACT ON PUBLIC HEALTH. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY LEVERAGES REDDIT, A SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM, AS THE PRIMARY DATA SOURCE TO INVESTIGATE THE OPIOID CRISIS. WE AIMED TO FIND A LARGE COHORT OF REDDIT USERS INTERESTED IN DISCUSSING THE USE OF OPIOIDS, TRACE THE TEMPORAL EVOLUTION OF THEIR INTEREST, AND EXTENSIVELY CHARACTERIZE PATTERNS OF THE NONMEDICAL CONSUMPTION OF OPIOIDS, WITH A FOCUS ON ROUTES OF ADMINISTRATION AND DRUG TAMPERING. METHODS: WE USED A SEMIAUTOMATIC INFORMATION RETRIEVAL ALGORITHM TO IDENTIFY SUBREDDITS DISCUSSING NONMEDICAL OPIOID CONSUMPTION AND DEVELOPED A METHODOLOGY BASED ON WORD EMBEDDING TO FIND ALTERNATIVE COLLOQUIAL AND NONMEDICAL TERMS REFERRING TO OPIOID SUBSTANCES, ROUTES OF ADMINISTRATION, AND DRUG-TAMPERING METHODS. WE MODELED THE PREFERENCES OF ADOPTION OF SUBSTANCES AND ROUTES OF ADMINISTRATION, ESTIMATING THEIR PREVALENCE AND TEMPORAL UNFOLDING. ULTIMATELY, THROUGH THE EVALUATION OF ODDS RATIOS BASED ON CO-MENTIONS, WE MEASURED THE STRENGTH OF ASSOCIATION BETWEEN OPIOID SUBSTANCES, ROUTES OF ADMINISTRATION, AND DRUG TAMPERING. RESULTS: WE IDENTIFIED 32 SUBREDDITS DISCUSSING NONMEDICAL OPIOID USAGE FROM 2014 TO 2018 AND OBSERVED THE EVOLUTION OF INTEREST AMONG OVER 86,000 REDDIT USERS POTENTIALLY INVOLVED IN FIRSTHAND OPIOID USAGE. WE LEARNED THE LANGUAGE MODEL OF OPIOID CONSUMPTION AND PROVIDED ALTERNATIVE VOCABULARIES FOR OPIOID SUBSTANCES, ROUTES OF ADMINISTRATION, AND DRUG TAMPERING. A DATA-DRIVEN TAXONOMY OF NONMEDICAL ROUTES OF ADMINISTRATION WAS PROPOSED. WE MODELED THE TEMPORAL EVOLUTION OF INTEREST IN OPIOID CONSUMPTION BY RANKING THE POPULARITY OF THE ADOPTION OF OPIOID SUBSTANCES AND ROUTES OF ADMINISTRATION, OBSERVING RELEVANT TRENDS, SUCH AS THE SURGE IN SYNTHETIC OPIOIDS LIKE FENTANYL AND AN INCREASING INTEREST IN RECTAL ADMINISTRATION. IN ADDITION, WE MEASURED THE STRENGTH OF ASSOCIATION BETWEEN DRUG TAMPERING, ROUTES OF ADMINISTRATION, AND SUBSTANCE CONSUMPTION, FINDING EVIDENCE OF UNDERSTUDIED ABUSIVE BEHAVIORS, LIKE CHEWING FENTANYL PATCHES AND DISSOLVING BUPRENORPHINE SUBLINGUALLY. CONCLUSIONS: THIS WORK INVESTIGATED SOME IMPORTANT CONSUMPTION-RELATED ASPECTS OF THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC USING REDDIT DATA. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR APPROACH MAY PROVIDE A NOVEL PERSPECTIVE FOR A MORE COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING OF NONMEDICAL ABUSE OF OPIOIDS SUBSTANCES AND INFORM THE PREVENTION, TREATMENT, AND CONTROL OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH EFFECTS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
PCFUN: A HYBRID COMPUTATIONAL FRAMEWORK FOR SYSTEMATIC CHARACTERIZATION OF PROTEIN COMPLEX FUNCTION. IN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY, IT IS A GENERAL ASSUMPTION THAT THE ENSEMBLE OF EXPRESSED MOLECULES, THEIR ACTIVITIES AND INTERACTIONS DETERMINE BIOLOGICAL FUNCTION, CELLULAR STATES AND PHENOTYPES. STABLE PROTEIN COMPLEXES-OR MACROMOLECULAR MACHINES-ARE, IN TURN, THE KEY FUNCTIONAL ENTITIES MEDIATING AND MODULATING MOST BIOLOGICAL PROCESSES. ALTHOUGH IDENTIFYING PROTEIN COMPLEXES AND THEIR SUBUNIT COMPOSITION CAN NOW BE DONE INEXPENSIVELY AND AT SCALE, DETERMINING THEIR FUNCTION REMAINS CHALLENGING AND LABOR INTENSIVE. THIS STUDY DESCRIBES PROTEIN COMPLEX FUNCTION PREDICTOR (PCFUN), THE FIRST COMPUTATIONAL FRAMEWORK FOR THE SYSTEMATIC ANNOTATION OF PROTEIN COMPLEX FUNCTIONS USING GENE ONTOLOGY (GO) TERMS. PCFUN IS BUILT UPON A WORD EMBEDDING USING NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING TECHNIQUES BASED ON 1 MILLION OPEN ACCESS PUBMED CENTRAL ARTICLES. SPECIFICALLY, PCFUN LEVERAGES TWO APPROACHES FOR ACCURATELY IDENTIFYING PROTEIN COMPLEX FUNCTION, INCLUDING: (I) AN UNSUPERVISED APPROACH THAT OBTAINS THE NEAREST NEIGHBOR (NN) GO TERM WORD VECTORS FOR A PROTEIN COMPLEX QUERY VECTOR AND (II) A SUPERVISED APPROACH USING RANDOM FOREST (RF) MODELS TRAINED SPECIFICALLY FOR RECOVERING THE GO TERMS OF PROTEIN COMPLEX QUERIES DESCRIBED IN THE CORUM PROTEIN COMPLEX DATABASE. PCFUN CONSOLIDATES BOTH APPROACHES BY PERFORMING A HYPERGEOMETRIC STATISTICAL TEST TO ENRICH THE TOP NN GO TERMS WITHIN THE CHILD TERMS OF THE GO TERMS PREDICTED BY THE RF MODELS. THE DOCUMENTATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PCFUN PACKAGE ARE AVAILABLE AT HTTPS://GITHUB.COM/SHARMAVARUNS/PCFUN. WE ANTICIPATE THAT PCFUN WILL SERVE AS A USEFUL TOOL AND NOVEL PARADIGM FOR THE LARGE-SCALE CHARACTERIZATION OF PROTEIN COMPLEX FUNCTION.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
PERSIAN SENTIMENT ANALYSIS OF AN ONLINE STORE INDEPENDENT OF PRE-PROCESSING USING CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK WITH FASTTEXT EMBEDDINGS. SENTIMENT ANALYSIS PLAYS A KEY ROLE IN COMPANIES, ESPECIALLY STORES, AND INCREASING THE ACCURACY IN DETERMINING CUSTOMERS' OPINIONS ABOUT PRODUCTS ASSISTS TO MAINTAIN THEIR COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS. WE INTEND TO ANALYZE THE USERS' OPINIONS ON THE WEBSITE OF THE MOST IMMENSE ONLINE STORE IN IRAN; DIGIKALA. HOWEVER, THE PERSIAN LANGUAGE IS UNSTRUCTURED WHICH MAKES THE PRE-PROCESSING STAGE VERY DIFFICULT AND IT IS THE MAIN PROBLEM OF SENTIMENT ANALYSIS IN PERSIAN. WHAT EXACERBATES THIS PROBLEM IS THE LACK OF AVAILABLE LIBRARIES FOR PERSIAN PRE-PROCESSING, WHILE MOST LIBRARIES FOCUS ON ENGLISH. TO TACKLE THIS, APPROXIMATELY 3 MILLION REVIEWS WERE GATHERED IN PERSIAN FROM THE DIGIKALA WEBSITE USING WEB-MINING TECHNIQUES, AND THE FASTTEXT METHOD WAS USED TO CREATE A WORD EMBEDDING. IT WAS ASSUMED THAT THIS WOULD DRAMATICALLY CUT DOWN ON THE NEED FOR TEXT PRE-PROCESSING THROUGH THE SKIP-GRAM METHOD CONSIDERING THE POSITION OF THE WORDS IN THE SENTENCE AND THE WORDS' RELATIONS TO EACH OTHER. ANOTHER WORD EMBEDDING HAS BEEN CREATED USING THE TF-IDF IN PARALLEL WITH FASTTEXT TO COMPARE THEIR PERFORMANCE. IN ADDITION, THE RESULTS OF THE CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (CNN), BILSTM, LOGISTIC REGRESSION, AND NAIVE BAYES MODELS HAVE BEEN COMPARED. AS A SIGNIFICANT RESULT, WE OBTAINED 0.996 AUC AND 0.956 F-SCORE USING FASTTEXT AND CNN. IN THIS ARTICLE, NOT ONLY HAS IT BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO WHAT EXTENT IT IS POSSIBLE TO BE INDEPENDENT OF PRE-PROCESSING BUT ALSO THE ACCURACY OBTAINED IS BETTER THAN OTHER RESEARCHES DONE IN PERSIAN. AVOIDING COMPLEX TEXT PREPROCESSING IS ALSO IMPORTANT FOR OTHER LANGUAGES SINCE MOST TEXT PREPROCESSING ALGORITHMS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED FOR ENGLISH AND CANNOT BE USED FOR OTHER LANGUAGES. THE CREATED WORD EMBEDDING DUE TO ITS HIGH ACCURACY AND INDEPENDENCE OF PRE-PROCESSING HAS OTHER APPLICATIONS IN PERSIAN BESIDES SENTIMENT ANALYSIS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
PERSON-PERSONALIZED EXPERT RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM FOR OPTIMIZED NUTRITION. THE RISE OF PERSONALIZED DIETS IS DUE TO THE EMERGENCE OF NUTRIGENETICS AND GENETIC TESTS SERVICES. HOWEVER, THE RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM IS FAR FROM MATURE TO PROVIDE PERSONALIZED FOOD SUGGESTION TO CONSUMERS FOR DAILY USAGE. THE MAIN BARRIER OF CONNECTING GENETIC INFORMATION TO PERSONALIZED DIETS IS THE COMPLEXITY OF DATA AND THE SCALABILITY OF THE APPLIED SYSTEMS. AIMING TO CROSS SUCH BARRIERS AND PROVIDE DIRECT APPLICATIONS, A PERSONALIZED EXPERT RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM FOR OPTIMIZED NUTRITION IS INTRODUCED IN THIS PAPER, WHICH PERFORMS DIRECT TO CONSUMER PERSONALIZED GROCERY PRODUCT FILTERING AND RECOMMENDATION. DEEP LEARNING NEURAL NETWORK MODEL IS APPLIED TO ACHIEVE AUTOMATIC PRODUCT CATEGORIZATION. THE ABILITY OF SCALING WITH UNKNOWN NEW DATA IS ACHIEVED THROUGH THE GENERALIZED REPRESENTATION OF WORD EMBEDDING. FURTHERMORE, THE CATEGORIZED PRODUCTS ARE FILTERED WITH A MODEL BASED ON INDIVIDUAL GENETIC DATA WITH ASSOCIATED PHENOTYPIC INFORMATION AND A CASE STUDY WITH DATABASES FROM THREE DIFFERENT SOURCES IS CARRIED OUT TO CONFIRM THE SYSTEM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
PERSONALITY CLASSIFICATION OF SOCIAL USERS BASED ON FEATURE FUSION. BASED ON THE OPENNESS AND ACCESSIBILITY OF USER DATA, PERSONALITY RECOGNITION IS WIDELY USED IN PERSONALIZED RECOMMENDATION, INTELLIGENT MEDICINE, NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING, AND SO ON. EXISTING APPROACHES USUALLY ADOPT A SINGLE DEEP LEARNING MECHANISM TO EXTRACT PERSONALITY INFORMATION FROM USER DATA, WHICH LEADS TO SEMANTIC LOSS TO SOME EXTENT. IN ADDITION, RESEARCHERS ENCODE SCATTERED USER POSTS IN A SEQUENTIAL OR HIERARCHICAL MANNER, IGNORING THE CONNECTION BETWEEN POSTS AND THE UNEQUAL VALUE OF DIFFERENT POSTS TO CLASSIFICATION TASKS. WE PROPOSE A HIERARCHICAL HYBRID MODEL BASED ON A SELF-ATTENTION MECHANISM, NAMELY HMATTN-ECBIL, TO FULLY EXCAVATE DEEP SEMANTIC INFORMATION HORIZONTALLY AND VERTICALLY. MULTIPLE MODULES COMPOSED OF CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK AND BI-DIRECTIONAL LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY ENCODE DIFFERENT TYPES OF PERSONALITY REPRESENTATIONS IN A HIERARCHICAL AND PARTITIONED MANNER, WHICH PAYS ATTENTION TO THE CONTRIBUTION OF DIFFERENT WORDS IN POSTS AND DIFFERENT POSTS TO PERSONALITY INFORMATION AND CAPTURES THE DEPENDENCIES BETWEEN SCATTERED POSTS. MOREOVER, THE ADDITION OF A WORD EMBEDDING MODULE EFFECTIVELY MAKES UP FOR THE ORIGINAL SEMANTICS FILTERED BY A DEEP NEURAL NETWORK. WE VERIFIED THE HYBRID MODEL ON THE MYPERSONALITY DATASET. THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE CLASSIFICATION PERFORMANCE OF THE HYBRID MODEL EXCEEDS THE DIFFERENT MODEL ARCHITECTURES AND BASELINE MODELS, AND THE AVERAGE ACCURACY REACHED 72.01%.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
PHARMACOVIGILANCE FROM SOCIAL MEDIA: MINING ADVERSE DRUG REACTION MENTIONS USING SEQUENCE LABELING WITH WORD EMBEDDING CLUSTER FEATURES. OBJECTIVE: SOCIAL MEDIA IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY POPULAR AS A PLATFORM FOR SHARING PERSONAL HEALTH-RELATED INFORMATION. THIS INFORMATION CAN BE UTILIZED FOR PUBLIC HEALTH MONITORING TASKS, PARTICULARLY FOR PHARMACOVIGILANCE, VIA THE USE OF NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) TECHNIQUES. HOWEVER, THE LANGUAGE IN SOCIAL MEDIA IS HIGHLY INFORMAL, AND USER-EXPRESSED MEDICAL CONCEPTS ARE OFTEN NONTECHNICAL, DESCRIPTIVE, AND CHALLENGING TO EXTRACT. THERE HAS BEEN LIMITED PROGRESS IN ADDRESSING THESE CHALLENGES, AND THUS FAR, ADVANCED MACHINE LEARNING-BASED NLP TECHNIQUES HAVE BEEN UNDERUTILIZED. OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO DESIGN A MACHINE LEARNING-BASED APPROACH TO EXTRACT MENTIONS OF ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS (ADRS) FROM HIGHLY INFORMAL TEXT IN SOCIAL MEDIA. METHODS: WE INTRODUCE ADRMINE, A MACHINE LEARNING-BASED CONCEPT EXTRACTION SYSTEM THAT USES CONDITIONAL RANDOM FIELDS (CRFS). ADRMINE UTILIZES A VARIETY OF FEATURES, INCLUDING A NOVEL FEATURE FOR MODELING WORDS' SEMANTIC SIMILARITIES. THE SIMILARITIES ARE MODELED BY CLUSTERING WORDS BASED ON UNSUPERVISED, PRETRAINED WORD REPRESENTATION VECTORS (EMBEDDINGS) GENERATED FROM UNLABELED USER POSTS IN SOCIAL MEDIA USING A DEEP LEARNING TECHNIQUE. RESULTS: ADRMINE OUTPERFORMS SEVERAL STRONG BASELINE SYSTEMS IN THE ADR EXTRACTION TASK BY ACHIEVING AN F-MEASURE OF 0.82. FEATURE ANALYSIS DEMONSTRATES THAT THE PROPOSED WORD CLUSTER FEATURES SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE EXTRACTION PERFORMANCE. CONCLUSION: IT IS POSSIBLE TO EXTRACT COMPLEX MEDICAL CONCEPTS, WITH RELATIVELY HIGH PERFORMANCE, FROM INFORMAL, USER-GENERATED CONTENT. OUR APPROACH IS PARTICULARLY SCALABLE, SUITABLE FOR SOCIAL MEDIA MINING, AS IT RELIES ON LARGE VOLUMES OF UNLABELED DATA, THUS DIMINISHING THE NEED FOR LARGE, ANNOTATED TRAINING DATA SETS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
PHARMKG: A DEDICATED KNOWLEDGE GRAPH BENCHMARK FOR BOMEDICAL DATA MINING. BIOMEDICAL KNOWLEDGE GRAPHS (KGS), WHICH CAN HELP WITH THE UNDERSTANDING OF COMPLEX BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS AND PATHOLOGIES, HAVE BEGUN TO PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN MEDICAL PRACTICE AND RESEARCH. HOWEVER, CHALLENGES REMAIN IN THEIR EMBEDDING AND USE DUE TO THEIR COMPLEX NATURE AND THE SPECIFIC DEMANDS OF THEIR CONSTRUCTION. EXISTING STUDIES OFTEN SUFFER FROM PROBLEMS SUCH AS SPARSE AND NOISY DATASETS, INSUFFICIENT MODELING METHODS AND NON-UNIFORM EVALUATION METRICS. IN THIS WORK, WE ESTABLISHED A COMPREHENSIVE KG SYSTEM FOR THE BIOMEDICAL FIELD IN AN ATTEMPT TO BRIDGE THE GAP. HERE, WE INTRODUCED PHARMKG, A MULTI-RELATIONAL, ATTRIBUTED BIOMEDICAL KG, COMPOSED OF MORE THAN 500 000 INDIVIDUAL INTERCONNECTIONS BETWEEN GENES, DRUGS AND DISEASES, WITH 29 RELATION TYPES OVER A VOCABULARY OF ~8000 DISAMBIGUATED ENTITIES. EACH ENTITY IN PHARMKG IS ATTACHED WITH HETEROGENEOUS, DOMAIN-SPECIFIC INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM MULTI-OMICS DATA, I.E. GENE EXPRESSION, CHEMICAL STRUCTURE AND DISEASE WORD EMBEDDING, WHILE PRESERVING THE SEMANTIC AND BIOMEDICAL FEATURES. FOR BASELINES, WE OFFERED NINE STATE-OF-THE-ART KG EMBEDDING (KGE) APPROACHES AND A NEW BIOLOGICAL, INTUITIVE, GRAPH NEURAL NETWORK-BASED KGE METHOD THAT USES A COMBINATION OF BOTH GLOBAL NETWORK STRUCTURE AND HETEROGENEOUS DOMAIN FEATURES. BASED ON THE PROPOSED BENCHMARK, WE CONDUCTED EXTENSIVE EXPERIMENTS TO ASSESS THESE KGE MODELS USING MULTIPLE EVALUATION METRICS. FINALLY, WE DISCUSSED OUR OBSERVATIONS ACROSS VARIOUS DOWNSTREAM BIOLOGICAL TASKS AND PROVIDE INSIGHTS AND GUIDELINES FOR HOW TO USE A KG IN BIOMEDICINE. WE HOPE THAT THE UNPRECEDENTED QUALITY AND DIVERSITY OF PHARMKG WILL LEAD TO ADVANCES IN BIOMEDICAL KG CONSTRUCTION, EMBEDDING AND APPLICATION.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
PHENOTYPE EXTRACTION BASED ON WORD EMBEDDING TO SENTENCE EMBEDDING CASCADED APPROACH. AS A SIGNIFICANT DETERMINANT IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION, PHENOTYPIC DESCRIPTIONS ARE NORMALLY PRESENTED DIFFERENTLY IN BIOMEDICAL LITERATURE WITH THE USE OF COMPLICATED SEMANTICS. IN THIS PAPER, A NOVEL APPROACH HAS BEEN PROPOSED TO IDENTIFY PLANT PHENOTYPES BY ADOPTING WORD EMBEDDING TO SENTENCE EMBEDDING CASCADED APPROACH. WE MAKE USE OF A WORD EMBEDDING METHOD TO FIND HIGH-FREQUENCY PHENOTYPES WITH ORIGINAL SENTENCES USED AS INPUT IN A SENTENCE EMBEDDING METHOD. IN DOING SO, A VARIETY OF COMPLICATED PHENOTYPIC EXPRESSIONS CAN BE RECOGNIZED ACCURATELY. BESIDES, THE STATE-OF-THE-ART WORD REPRESENTATION MODELS HAVE BEEN COMPARED AND AMONG THEM, SKIP-GRAM WITH NEGATIVE SAMPLING WAS SELECTED WITH THE BEST PERFORMANCE. TO EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR APPROACH, WE APPLIED IT TO THE DATASET COMPOSED OF 56 748 PUBMED ABSTRACTS OF MODEL ORGANISM ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA. THE EXPERIMENT RESULTS SHOWED THAT OUR APPROACH YIELDED THE BEST PERFORMANCE, AS IT ACHIEVED A 2.588-FOLD INCREASE IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF NEW PHENOTYPIC DESCRIPTIONS WHEN COMPARED TO THE ORIGINAL PHENOTYPE ONTOLOGY.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
PREDICTING ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE: ANALYSIS OF STUDENTS' MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION FROM SOCIAL MEDIA INTERACTIONS. SOCIAL MEDIA HAVE BECOME AN INDISPENSABLE PART OF PEOPLES' DAILY LIVES. RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT INTERACTIONS ON SOCIAL MEDIA PARTLY EXHIBIT INDIVIDUALS' PERSONALITY, SENTIMENT, AND BEHAVIOR. IN THIS STUDY, WE EXAMINE THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN STUDENTS' MENTAL HEALTH AND PSYCHOLOGICAL ATTRIBUTES DERIVED FROM SOCIAL MEDIA INTERACTIONS AND ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE. WE BUILD A CLASSIFICATION MODEL WHERE STUDENTS' PSYCHOLOGICAL ATTRIBUTES AND MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES WILL BE PREDICTED FROM THEIR SOCIAL MEDIA INTERACTIONS. THEN, STUDENTS' ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE WILL BE IDENTIFIED FROM THEIR PREDICTED PSYCHOLOGICAL ATTRIBUTES AND MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES IN THE PREVIOUS LEVEL. FIRSTLY, WE SELECT SAMPLES BY USING JUDGMENTAL SAMPLING TECHNIQUE AND COLLECT THE TEXTUAL CONTENT FROM STUDENTS' FACEBOOK NEWS FEEDS. THEN, WE DERIVE FEATURE VECTORS USING MPNET (MASKED AND PERMUTED PRE-TRAINING FOR LANGUAGE UNDERSTANDING), WHICH IS ONE OF THE LATEST PRE-TRAINED SENTENCE TRANSFORMER MODELS. SECONDLY, WE FIND TWO DIFFERENT LEVELS OF CORRELATIONS: (I) USERS' SOCIAL MEDIA USAGE AND THEIR PSYCHOLOGICAL ATTRIBUTES AND MENTAL HEALTH STATUS AND (II) USERS' PSYCHOLOGICAL ATTRIBUTES AND MENTAL HEALTH STATUS AND THEIR ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE. THIRDLY, WE BUILD A TWO-LEVEL HYBRID MODEL TO PREDICT ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE (I.E., GRADE POINT AVERAGE (GPA)) FROM STUDENTS' FACEBOOK POSTS: (1) FROM FACEBOOK POSTS TO MENTAL HEALTH AND PSYCHOLOGICAL ATTRIBUTES USING A REGRESSION MODEL (SM-MP MODEL) AND (2) FROM PSYCHOLOGICAL AND MENTAL ATTRIBUTES TO THE ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE USING A CLASSIFIER MODEL (MP-AP MODEL). LATER, WE CONDUCT AN EVALUATION STUDY BY USING REAL-LIFE SAMPLES TO VALIDATE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE MODEL AND COMPARE THE PERFORMANCE WITH BASELINE MODELS (I.E., LINGUISTIC INQUIRY AND WORD COUNT (LIWC) AND EMPATH). OUR MODEL SHOWS A STRONG PERFORMANCE WITH A MICROAVERAGE F-SCORE OF 0.94 AND AN AUC-ROC SCORE OF 0.95. FINALLY, WE BUILD AN ENSEMBLE MODEL BY COMBINING BOTH THE PSYCHOLOGICAL ATTRIBUTES AND THE MENTAL HEALTH MODELS AND FIND THAT OUR COMBINED MODEL OUTPERFORMS THE INDEPENDENT MODELS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
PREDICTING DIABETES SECOND-LINE THERAPY INITIATION IN THE AUSTRALIAN POPULATION VIA TIME SPAN-GUIDED NEURAL ATTENTION NETWORK. INTRODUCTION: THE FIRST LINE OF TREATMENT FOR PEOPLE WITH DIABETES MELLITUS IS METFORMIN. HOWEVER, OVER THE COURSE OF THE DISEASE METFORMIN MAY FAIL TO ACHIEVE APPROPRIATE GLYCEMIC CONTROL, AND A SECOND-LINE THERAPY MAY BECOME NECESSARY. IN THIS PAPER WE INTRODUCE TANGLE, A TIME SPAN-GUIDED NEURAL ATTENTION MODEL THAT CAN ACCURATELY AND TIMELY PREDICT THE UPCOMING NEED FOR A SECOND-LINE DIABETES THERAPY FROM ADMINISTRATIVE DATA IN THE AUSTRALIAN ADULT POPULATION. THE METHOD IS SUITABLE FOR DESIGNING AUTOMATIC THERAPY REVIEW RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PATIENTS AND THEIR PROVIDERS WITHOUT THE NEED TO COLLECT CLINICAL MEASURES. DATA: WE ANALYZED SEVEN YEARS OF DE-IDENTIFIED RECORDS (2008-2014) OF THE 10% PUBLICLY AVAILABLE LINKED SAMPLE OF MEDICARE BENEFITS SCHEDULE (MBS) AND PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFITS SCHEME (PBS) ELECTRONIC DATABASES OF AUSTRALIA. METHODS: BY DESIGN, TANGLE INHERITS THE REPRESENTATIONAL POWER OF PRE-TRAINED WORD EMBEDDING, SUCH AS GLOVE, TO ENCODE SEQUENCES OF CLAIMS WITH THE RELATED MBS CODES. MOREOVER, THE PROPOSED ATTENTION MECHANISM NATIVELY EXPLOITS THE INFORMATION HIDDEN IN THE TIME SPAN BETWEEN TWO SUCCESSIVE CLAIMS (MEASURED IN NUMBER OF DAYS). WE COMPARED THE PROPOSED METHOD AGAINST STATE-OF-THE-ART SEQUENCE CLASSIFICATION METHODS. RESULTS: TANGLE OUTPERFORMS STATE-OF-THE-ART RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORKS, INCLUDING ATTENTION-BASED MODELS. IN PARTICULAR, WHEN THE PROPOSED TIME SPAN-GUIDED ATTENTION STRATEGY IS COUPLED WITH PRE-TRAINED EMBEDDING METHODS, THE MODEL PERFORMANCE REACHES AN AREA UNDER THE ROC CURVE OF 90%, AN IMPROVEMENT OF ALMOST 10 PERCENTAGE POINTS OVER AN ATTENTIONLESS RECURRENT ARCHITECTURE. IMPLEMENTATION: TANGLE IS IMPLEMENTED IN PYTHON USING KERAS AND IT IS HOSTED ON GITHUB AT HTTPS://GITHUB.COM/SAMUELEFIORINI/TANGLE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
PREDICTING MORTALITY IN CRITICALLY ILL PATIENTS WITH DIABETES USING MACHINE LEARNING AND CLINICAL NOTES. BACKGROUND: DIABETES MELLITUS IS A PREVALENT METABOLIC DISEASE CHARACTERIZED BY CHRONIC HYPERGLYCEMIA. THE AVALANCHE OF HEALTHCARE DATA IS ACCELERATING PRECISION AND PERSONALIZED MEDICINE. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND ALGORITHM-BASED APPROACHES ARE BECOMING MORE AND MORE VITAL TO SUPPORT CLINICAL DECISION-MAKING. THESE METHODS ARE ABLE TO AUGMENT HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS BY TAKING AWAY SOME OF THEIR ROUTINE WORK AND ENABLING THEM TO FOCUS ON CRITICAL ISSUES. HOWEVER, FEW STUDIES HAVE USED PREDICTIVE MODELING TO UNCOVER ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN COMORBIDITIES IN ICU PATIENTS AND DIABETES. THIS STUDY AIMED TO USE UNIFIED MEDICAL LANGUAGE SYSTEM (UMLS) RESOURCES, INVOLVING MACHINE LEARNING AND NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) APPROACHES TO PREDICT THE RISK OF MORTALITY. METHODS: WE CONDUCTED A SECONDARY ANALYSIS OF MEDICAL INFORMATION MART FOR INTENSIVE CARE III (MIMIC-III) DATA. DIFFERENT MACHINE LEARNING MODELING AND NLP APPROACHES WERE APPLIED. DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE IN HEALTH CARE IS BUILT ON THE DICTIONARIES CREATED BY EXPERTS WHO DEFINED THE CLINICAL TERMINOLOGIES SUCH AS MEDICATIONS OR CLINICAL SYMPTOMS. THIS KNOWLEDGE IS VALUABLE TO IDENTIFY INFORMATION FROM TEXT NOTES THAT ASSERT A CERTAIN DISEASE. KNOWLEDGE-GUIDED MODELS CAN AUTOMATICALLY EXTRACT KNOWLEDGE FROM CLINICAL NOTES OR BIOMEDICAL LITERATURE THAT CONTAINS CONCEPTUAL ENTITIES AND RELATIONSHIPS AMONG THESE VARIOUS CONCEPTS. MORTALITY CLASSIFICATION WAS BASED ON THE COMBINATION OF KNOWLEDGE-GUIDED FEATURES AND RULES. UMLS ENTITY EMBEDDING AND CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (CNN) WITH WORD EMBEDDINGS WERE APPLIED. CONCEPT UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS (CUIS) WITH ENTITY EMBEDDINGS WERE UTILIZED TO BUILD CLINICAL TEXT REPRESENTATIONS. RESULTS: THE BEST CONFIGURATION OF THE EMPLOYED MACHINE LEARNING MODELS YIELDED A COMPETITIVE AUC OF 0.97. MACHINE LEARNING MODELS ALONG WITH NLP OF CLINICAL NOTES ARE PROMISING TO ASSIST HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS TO PREDICT THE RISK OF MORTALITY OF CRITICALLY ILL PATIENTS. CONCLUSION: UMLS RESOURCES AND CLINICAL NOTES ARE POWERFUL AND IMPORTANT TOOLS TO PREDICT MORTALITY IN DIABETIC PATIENTS IN THE CRITICAL CARE SETTING. THE KNOWLEDGE-GUIDED CNN MODEL IS EFFECTIVE (AUC = 0.97) FOR LEARNING HIDDEN FEATURES.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
PREDICTING OF ANAPHYLAXIS IN BIG DATA EMR BY EXPLORING MACHINE LEARNING APPROACHES. ANAPHYLAXIS IS A LIFE-THREATENING ALLERGIC REACTION THAT OCCURS SUDDENLY AFTER CONTACT WITH AN ALLERGEN. EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES ABOUT ANAPHYLAXIS ARE VERY IMPORTANT IN PLANNING AND EVALUATING NEW STRATEGIES THAT PREVENT THIS REACTION, BUT ALSO IN PROVIDING A GUIDE TO THE TREATMENT OF PATIENTS WHO HAVE JUST SUFFERED AN ANAPHYLACTIC REACTION. ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS (EMR) ARE ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE AND RICHEST SOURCES FOR THE EPIDEMIOLOGY OF ANAPHYLAXIS, BECAUSE THEY PROVIDE A LOW-COST WAY OF ACCESSING RICH LONGITUDINAL DATA ON LARGE POPULATIONS. HOWEVER, A NEGATIVE ASPECT IS THAT RESEARCHERS HAVE TO MANUALLY REVIEW A HUGE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION, WHICH IS A VERY COSTLY AND HIGHLY TIME CONSUMING TASK. THEREFORE, OUR GOAL IS TO EXPLORE DIFFERENT MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES TO PROCESS BIG DATA EMR, LESSENING THE NEEDED EFFORTS FOR PERFORMING EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES ABOUT ANAPHYLAXIS. IN PARTICULAR, WE AIM TO STUDY THE INCIDENCE OF ANAPHYLAXIS BY THE AUTOMATIC CLASSIFICATION OF EMR. TO DO THIS, WE EMPLOY THE MOST WIDELY USED AND EFFICIENT CLASSIFIERS IN TEXT CLASSIFICATION AND COMPARE DIFFERENT DOCUMENT REPRESENTATIONS, WHICH RANGE FROM WELL-KNOWN METHODS SUCH AS BAG OF WORDS (BOW) TO MORE RECENT ONES BASED ON WORD EMBEDDING MODELS, SUCH AS A SIMPLE AVERAGE OF WORD EMBEDDINGS OR A BAG OF CENTROIDS OF WORD EMBEDDINGS. BECAUSE THE IDENTIFICATION OF ANAPHYLAXIS CASES IN EMR IS A CLASS-IMBALANCED PROBLEM (LESS THAN 1% DESCRIBE ANAPHYLAXIS CASES), WE EMPLOY A NOVEL UNDERSAMPLING TECHNIQUE BASED ON CLUSTERING TO BALANCE OUR DATASET. IN ADDITION TO CLASSICAL MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS, WE ALSO USE A CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (CNN) TO CLASSIFY OUR DATASET. IN GENERAL, EXPERIMENTS SHOW THAT THE MOST CLASSIFIERS AND REPRESENTATIONS ARE EFFECTIVE (F1 ABOVE 90%). LOGISTIC REGRESSION, LINEAR SVM, MULTILAYER PERCEPTRON AND RANDOM FOREST ACHIEVE AN F1 AROUND 95%, HOWEVER LINEAR METHODS HAVE CONSIDERABLY LOWER TRAINING TIMES. CNN PROVIDES SLIGHTLY BETTER PERFORMANCE (F1=95.6%).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
PREDICTING POPULARITY OF VIDEO STREAMING SERVICES WITH REPRESENTATION LEARNING: A SURVEY AND A REAL-WORLD CASE STUDY. THE INTERNET'S POPULARIZATION HAS INCREASED THE AMOUNT OF CONTENT PRODUCED AND CONSUMED ON THE WEB. TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS NEW MARKET, MAJOR CONTENT PRODUCERS SUCH AS NETFLIX AND AMAZON PRIME HAVE EMERGED, FOCUSING ON VIDEO STREAMING SERVICES. HOWEVER, DESPITE THE LARGE NUMBER AND DIVERSITY OF VIDEOS MADE AVAILABLE BY THESE CONTENT PROVIDERS, FEW OF THEM ATTRACT THE ATTENTION OF MOST USERS. FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE DATA EXPLORED IN THIS ARTICLE, ONLY 6% OF THE MOST POPULAR VIDEOS ACCOUNT FOR 85% OF TOTAL VIEWS. FINDING OUT IN ADVANCE WHICH VIDEOS WILL BE POPULAR IS NOT TRIVIAL, ESPECIALLY GIVEN MANY INFLUENCING VARIABLES. NEVERTHELESS, A TOOL WITH THIS ABILITY WOULD BE OF GREAT VALUE TO HELP DIMENSION NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE AND PROPERLY RECOMMEND NEW CONTENT TO USERS. IN THIS WAY, THIS MANUSCRIPT EXAMINES THE MACHINE LEARNING-BASED APPROACHES THAT HAVE BEEN PROPOSED TO SOLVE THE PREDICTION OF WEB CONTENT POPULARITY. TO THIS END, WE FIRST SURVEY THE LITERATURE AND ELABORATE A TAXONOMY THAT CLASSIFIES MODELS ACCORDING TO PREDICTIVE FEATURES AND DESCRIBES STATE-OF-THE-ART FEATURES AND TECHNIQUES USED TO SOLVE THIS TASK. WHILE ANALYZING PREVIOUS WORKS, WE SAW AN OPPORTUNITY TO USE TEXTUAL FEATURES FOR VIDEO PREDICTION. THUS, ADDITIONALLY, WE PROPOSE A CASE STUDY THAT COMBINES FEATURES ACQUIRED THROUGH ATTRIBUTE ENGINEERING AND WORD EMBEDDING TO PREDICT THE POPULARITY OF A VIDEO. THE FIRST APPROACH IS BASED ON PREDICTIVE ATTRIBUTES DEFINED BY RESOURCE ENGINEERING. THE SECOND TAKES ADVANTAGE OF WORD EMBEDDINGS FROM VIDEO DESCRIPTIONS AND TITLES. WE EXPERIMENTED WITH THE PROPOSED TECHNIQUES IN A SET OF VIDEOS FROM GLOBOPLAY, THE LARGEST PROVIDER OF VIDEO STREAMING SERVICES IN LATIN AMERICA. A COMBINATION OF ENGINEERING FEATURES AND EMBEDDINGS USING THE RANDOM FOREST ALGORITHM ACHIEVED THE BEST RESULT, WITH AN ACCURACY OF 87%.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
PREDICTING TRANSITION WORDS BETWEEN SENTENCE FOR ENGLISH AND SPANISH MEDICAL TEXT. TRANSITION WORDS ADD IMPORTANT INFORMATION AND ARE USEFUL FOR INCREASING TEXT COMPREHENSION FOR READERS. OUR GOAL IS TO AUTOMATICALLY DETECT TRANSITION WORDS IN THE MEDICAL DOMAIN. WE INTRODUCE A NEW DATASET FOR IDENTIFYING TRANSITION WORDS CATEGORIZED INTO 16 DIFFERENT TYPES WITH OCCURRENCES IN ADJACENT SENTENCE PAIRS IN MEDICAL TEXTS FROM ENGLISH AND SPANISH WIKIPEDIA (70K AND 27K EXAMPLES, RESPECTIVELY). WE PROVIDE CLASSIFICATION RESULTS USING A FEEDFORWARD NEURAL NETWORK WITH WORD EMBEDDING FEATURES. OVERALL, WE DETECT THE NEED FOR A TRANSITION WORD WITH 78% ACCURACY IN ENGLISH AND 84% IN SPANISH. FOR INDIVIDUAL TRANSITION WORD CATEGORIES, PERFORMANCE VARIES WIDELY AND IS NOT RELATED TO EITHER THE NUMBER OF TRAINING EXAMPLES OR THE NUMBER OF TRANSITION WORDS IN THE CATEGORY. THE BEST ACCURACY IN ENGLISH WAS FOR EXAMPLIFICATION WORDS (82%) AND IN SPANISH FOR CONTRAST WORDS (96%).

ALTHOUGH DEEP LEARNING (DL) USING BRAIN MRI WITH CERTAIN IMAGE BIOMARKERS HAS SHOWN SATISFACTORY RESULTS IN PREDICTING POOR OUTCOMES, NO STUDY HAS ASSESSED THE USEFULNESS OF NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP)-BASED MACHINE LEARNING (ML) ALGORITHMS USING BRAIN MRI FREE-TEXT REPORTS OF AIS PATIENTS. THEREFORE, WE AIMED TO ASSESS WHETHER NLP-BASED ML ALGORITHMS USING BRAIN MRI TEXT REPORTS COULD PREDICT POOR OUTCOMES IN AIS PATIENTS. THIS STUDY INCLUDED ONLY ENGLISH TEXT REPORTS OF BRAIN MRIS EXAMINED DURING ADMISSION OF AIS PATIENTS. POOR OUTCOME WAS DEFINED AS A MODIFIED RANKIN SCALE SCORE OF 3-6, AND THE DATA WERE CAPTURED BY TRAINED NURSES AND PHYSICIANS. WE ONLY INCLUDED MRI TEXT REPORT OF THE FIRST MRI SCAN DURING THE ADMISSION. THE TEXT DATASET WAS RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO A TRAINING AND TEST DATASET WITH A 7:3 RATIO. TEXT WAS VECTORIZED TO WORD, SENTENCE, AND DOCUMENT LEVELS. IN THE WORD LEVEL APPROACH, WHICH DID NOT CONSIDER THE SEQUENCE OF WORDS, AND THE "BAG-OF-WORDS" MODEL WAS USED TO REFLECT THE NUMBER OF REPETITIONS OF TEXT TOKEN. THE "SENT2VEC" METHOD WAS USED IN THE SENSATION-LEVEL APPROACH CONSIDERING THE SEQUENCE OF WORDS, AND THE WORD EMBEDDING WAS USED IN THE DOCUMENT LEVEL APPROACH. IN ADDITION TO CONVENTIONAL ML ALGORITHMS, DL ALGORITHMS SUCH AS THE CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (CNN), LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY, AND MULTILAYER PERCEPTRON WERE USED TO PREDICT POOR OUTCOMES USING 5-FOLD CROSS-VALIDATION AND GRID SEARCH TECHNIQUES. THE PERFORMANCE OF EACH ML CLASSIFIER WAS COMPARED WITH THE AREA UNDER THE RECEIVER OPERATING CHARACTERISTIC (AUROC) CURVE. AMONG 1840 SUBJECTS WITH AIS, 645 PATIENTS (35.1%) HAD A POOR OUTCOME 3 MONTHS AFTER THE STROKE ONSET. RANDOM FOREST WAS THE BEST CLASSIFIER (0.782 OF AUROC) USING A WORD-LEVEL APPROACH. OVERALL, THE DOCUMENT-LEVEL APPROACH EXHIBITED BETTER PERFORMANCE THAN DID THE WORD- OR SENTENCE-LEVEL APPROACHES. AMONG ALL THE ML CLASSIFIERS, THE MULTI-CNN ALGORITHM DEMONSTRATED THE BEST CLASSIFICATION PERFORMANCE (0.805), FOLLOWED BY THE CNN (0.799) ALGORITHM. WHEN PREDICTING FUTURE CLINICAL OUTCOMES USING NLP-BASED ML OF RADIOLOGY FREE-TEXT REPORTS OF BRAIN MRI, DL ALGORITHMS SHOWED SUPERIOR PERFORMANCE OVER THE OTHER ML ALGORITHMS. IN PARTICULAR, THE PREDICTION OF POOR OUTCOMES IN DOCUMENT-LEVEL NLP DL WAS IMPROVED MORE BY MULTI-CNN AND CNN THAN BY RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORK-BASED ALGORITHMS. NLP-BASED DL ALGORITHMS CAN BE USED AS AN IMPORTANT DIGITAL MARKER FOR UNSTRUCTURED ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD DATA DL PREDICTION.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
PREDICTION TASK GUIDED REPRESENTATION LEARNING OF MEDICAL CODES IN EHR. THERE HAVE BEEN RAPIDLY GROWING APPLICATIONS USING MACHINE LEARNING MODELS FOR PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS IN ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS (EHR) TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF HOSPITAL SERVICES AND THE EFFICIENCY OF HEALTHCARE RESOURCE UTILIZATION. A FUNDAMENTAL AND CRUCIAL STEP IN DEVELOPING SUCH MODELS IS TO CONVERT MEDICAL CODES IN EHR TO FEATURE VECTORS. THESE MEDICAL CODES ARE USED TO REPRESENT DIAGNOSES OR PROCEDURES. THEIR VECTOR REPRESENTATIONS HAVE A TREMENDOUS IMPACT ON THE PERFORMANCE OF MACHINE LEARNING MODELS. RECENTLY, SOME RESEARCHERS HAVE UTILIZED REPRESENTATION LEARNING METHODS FROM NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) TO LEARN VECTOR REPRESENTATIONS OF MEDICAL CODES. HOWEVER, MOST PREVIOUS APPROACHES ARE UNSUPERVISED, I.E. THE GENERATION OF MEDICAL CODE VECTORS IS INDEPENDENT FROM PREDICTION TASKS. THUS, THE OBTAINED FEATURE VECTORS MAY BE INAPPROPRIATE FOR A SPECIFIC PREDICTION TASK. MOREOVER, UNSUPERVISED METHODS OFTEN REQUIRE A LOT OF SAMPLES TO OBTAIN RELIABLE RESULTS, BUT MOST PRACTICAL PROBLEMS HAVE VERY LIMITED PATIENT SAMPLES. IN THIS PAPER, WE DEVELOP A NEW METHOD CALLED PREDICTION TASK GUIDED HEALTH RECORD AGGREGATION (PTGHRA), WHICH AGGREGATES HEALTH RECORDS GUIDED BY PREDICTION TASKS, TO CONSTRUCT TRAINING CORPUS FOR VARIOUS REPRESENTATION LEARNING MODELS. COMPARED WITH UNSUPERVISED APPROACHES, REPRESENTATION LEARNING MODELS INTEGRATED WITH PTGHRA YIELD A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN PREDICTIVE CAPABILITY OF GENERATED MEDICAL CODE VECTORS, ESPECIALLY FOR LIMITED TRAINING SAMPLES.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
PREDICTIVE MODELING FOR OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY OUTCOMES AND DAYS AWAY FROM WORK ANALYSIS IN MINING OPERATIONS. MINING IS KNOWN TO BE ONE OF THE MOST HAZARDOUS OCCUPATIONS IN THE WORLD. MANY SERIOUS ACCIDENTS HAVE OCCURRED WORLDWIDE OVER THE YEARS IN MINING. ALTHOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN EFFORTS TO CREATE A SAFER WORK ENVIRONMENT FOR MINERS, THE NUMBER OF ACCIDENTS OCCURRING AT THE MINING SITES IS STILL SIGNIFICANT. MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES AND PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS ARE BECOMING ONE OF THE LEADING RESOURCES TO CREATE SAFER WORK ENVIRONMENTS IN THE MANUFACTURING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRIES. THESE TECHNIQUES ARE LEVERAGED TO GENERATE ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS TO IMPROVE DECISION-MAKING. A LARGE AMOUNT OF MINING SAFETY-RELATED DATA ARE AVAILABLE, AND MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS CAN BE USED TO ANALYZE THE DATA. THE USE OF MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES CAN SIGNIFICANTLY BENEFIT THE MINING INDUSTRY. DECISION TREE, RANDOM FOREST, AND ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS WERE IMPLEMENTED TO ANALYZE THE OUTCOMES OF MINING ACCIDENTS. THESE MACHINE LEARNING MODELS WERE ALSO USED TO PREDICT DAYS AWAY FROM WORK. AN ACCIDENTS DATASET PROVIDED BY THE MINE SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION WAS USED TO TRAIN THE MODELS. THE MODELS WERE TRAINED SEPARATELY ON TABULAR DATA AND NARRATIVES. THE USE OF A SYNTHETIC DATA AUGMENTATION TECHNIQUE USING WORD EMBEDDING WAS ALSO INVESTIGATED TO TACKLE THE DATA IMBALANCE PROBLEM. PERFORMANCE OF ALL THE MODELS WAS COMPARED WITH THE PERFORMANCE OF THE TRADITIONAL LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODEL. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT MODELS TRAINED ON NARRATIVES PERFORMED BETTER THAN THE MODELS TRAINED ON STRUCTURED/TABULAR DATA IN PREDICTING THE OUTCOME OF THE ACCIDENT. THE HIGHER PREDICTIVE POWER OF THE MODELS TRAINED ON NARRATIVES LED TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE NARRATIVES HAVE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELEVANT TO THE OUTCOME OF INJURY COMPARED TO THE TABULAR ENTRIES. THE MODELS TRAINED ON TABULAR DATA HAD A LOWER MEAN SQUARED ERROR COMPARED TO THE MODELS TRAINED ON NARRATIVES WHILE PREDICTING THE DAYS AWAY FROM WORK. THE RESULTS HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE OF PREDICTORS, LIKE SHIFT START TIME, ACCIDENT TIME, AND MINING EXPERIENCE IN PREDICTING THE DAYS AWAY FROM WORK. IT WAS FOUND THAT THE F1 SCORE OF ALL THE UNDERREPRESENTED CLASSES EXCEPT ONE IMPROVED AFTER THE USE OF THE DATA AUGMENTATION TECHNIQUE. THIS APPROACH GAVE GREATER INSIGHT INTO THE FACTORS INFLUENCING THE OUTCOME OF THE ACCIDENT AND DAYS AWAY FROM WORK.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
PROCESS ALARM PREDICTION USING DEEP LEARNING AND WORD EMBEDDING METHODS. INDUSTRIAL ALARM SYSTEMS PLAY AN ESSENTIAL ROLE FOR THE SAFE MANAGEMENT OF PROCESS OPERATIONS. WITH THE INCREASE IN AUTOMATION AND INSTRUMENTATION OF MODERN PROCESS PLANTS, THE NUMBER OF ALARMS THAT THE OPERATORS MANAGE HAS ALSO INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY. THE OPERATORS ARE EXPECTED TO MAKE CRITICAL DECISIONS IN THE PRESENCE OF FLOODING ALARMS, POORLY CONFIGURED AND MAINTAINED ALARMS AND MANY NUISANCE ALARMS. IN THIS ENVIRONMENT, IF THE INCOMING ALARMS CAN BE CORRECTLY PREDICTED BEFORE THEY ACTUALLY OCCUR, THE OPERATORS MAY HAVE A CHANCE TO ADDRESS AND POSSIBLY AVOID ABNORMAL BEHAVIORS BY TAKING CORRECTIVE ACTIONS IN TIME. INSPIRED BY THE APPLICATION OF DEEP LEARNING IN NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING, THIS PAPER PRESENTS AN ALARM PREDICTION METHOD BASED ON WORD EMBEDDING AND RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORKS TO PREDICT THE NEXT ALARM IN A PROCESS SETTING. THIS REPRESENTS BOTH A NOVEL APPROACH TO ALARM MANAGEMENT AS WELL AS A NOVEL APPLICATION OF NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING AND DEEP LEARNING TECHNIQUES TO THIS PROBLEM. THE PROPOSED METHOD IS APPLIED TO AN ACTUAL CASE STUDY TO DEMONSTRATE ITS PERFORMANCE.

HOWEVER, THEY ARE LIMITED BY THE QUALITY OF INITIAL WORD EMBEDDINGS. WORD EMBEDDING TRAINED BY ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS (EHRS) IS CONSIDERED THE BEST, BUT THE VOCABULARY DIVERSITY IS LIMITED BY PREVIOUS MEDICAL RECORDS. THUS, WE REQUIRE A WORD EMBEDDING MODEL THAT MAINTAINS THE VOCABULARY DIVERSITY OF OPEN INTERNET DATABASES AND THE MEDICAL TERMINOLOGY UNDERSTANDING OF EHRS. MOREOVER, WE NEED TO CONSIDER THE PARTICULARITY OF THE DISEASE CLASSIFICATION, WHEREIN DISCHARGE NOTES PRESENT ONLY POSITIVE DISEASE DESCRIPTIONS. OBJECTIVE: WE AIMED TO PROPOSE A PROJECTION WORD2VEC MODEL AND A HYBRID SAMPLING METHOD. IN ADDITION, WE AIMED TO CONDUCT A SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS TO VALIDATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE METHODS. METHODS: WE COMPARED THE PROJECTION WORD2VEC MODEL AND TRADITIONAL WORD2VEC MODEL USING TWO CORPORA SOURCES: ENGLISH WIKIPEDIA AND PUBMED JOURNAL ABSTRACTS. WE USED SEVEN PUBLISHED DATASETS TO MEASURE THE MEDICAL SEMANTIC UNDERSTANDING OF THE WORD2VEC MODELS AND USED THESE EMBEDDINGS TO IDENTIFY THE THREE-CHARACTER-LEVEL ICD-10-CM DIAGNOSTIC CODES IN A SET OF DISCHARGE NOTES. ON THE BASIS OF EMBEDDING TECHNOLOGY IMPROVEMENT, WE ALSO TRIED TO APPLY THE HYBRID SAMPLING METHOD TO IMPROVE ACCURACY. THE 94,483 LABELED DISCHARGE NOTES FROM THE TRI-SERVICE GENERAL HOSPITAL OF TAIPEI, TAIWAN, FROM JUNE 1, 2015, TO JUNE 30, 2017, WERE USED. TO EVALUATE THE MODEL PERFORMANCE, 24,762 DISCHARGE NOTES FROM JULY 1, 2017, TO DECEMBER 31, 2017, FROM THE SAME HOSPITAL WERE USED. MOREOVER, 74,324 ADDITIONAL DISCHARGE NOTES COLLECTED FROM SEVEN OTHER HOSPITALS WERE TESTED. THE F-MEASURE, WHICH IS THE MAJOR GLOBAL MEASURE OF EFFECTIVENESS, WAS ADOPTED. RESULTS: IN MEDICAL SEMANTIC UNDERSTANDING, THE ORIGINAL EHR EMBEDDINGS AND PUBMED EMBEDDINGS EXHIBITED SUPERIOR PERFORMANCE TO THE ORIGINAL WIKIPEDIA EMBEDDINGS. AFTER PROJECTION TRAINING TECHNOLOGY WAS APPLIED, THE PROJECTION WIKIPEDIA EMBEDDINGS EXHIBITED AN OBVIOUS IMPROVEMENT BUT DID NOT REACH THE LEVEL OF ORIGINAL EHR EMBEDDINGS OR PUBMED EMBEDDINGS. IN THE SUBSEQUENT ICD-10-CM CODING EXPERIMENT, THE MODEL THAT USED BOTH PROJECTION PUBMED AND WIKIPEDIA EMBEDDINGS HAD THE HIGHEST TESTING MEAN F-MEASURE (0.7362 AND 0.6693 IN TRI-SERVICE GENERAL HOSPITAL AND THE SEVEN OTHER HOSPITALS, RESPECTIVELY). MOREOVER, THE HYBRID SAMPLING METHOD WAS FOUND TO IMPROVE THE MODEL PERFORMANCE (F-MEASURE=0.7371/0.6698). CONCLUSIONS: THE WORD EMBEDDINGS TRAINED USING EHR AND PUBMED COULD UNDERSTAND MEDICAL SEMANTICS BETTER, AND THE PROPOSED PROJECTION WORD2VEC MODEL IMPROVED THE ABILITY OF MEDICAL SEMANTICS EXTRACTION IN WIKIPEDIA EMBEDDINGS. ALTHOUGH THE IMPROVEMENT FROM THE PROJECTION WORD2VEC MODEL IN THE REAL ICD-10-CM CODING TASK WAS NOT SUBSTANTIAL, THE MODELS COULD EFFECTIVELY HANDLE EMERGING DISEASES. THE PROPOSED HYBRID SAMPLING METHOD ENABLES THE MODEL TO BEHAVE LIKE A HUMAN EXPERT.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION RECOGNITION BY FINE-TUNING A PRE-TRAINING TRANSFORMER MODEL. OBJECTIVE: DE-IDENTIFYING PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION (PHI) IN MEDICAL DOCUMENTS IS IMPORTANT, AND A PREREQUISITE TO DEIDENTIFICATION IS THE IDENTIFICATION OF PHI ENTITY NAMES IN CLINICAL DOCUMENTS. THIS STUDY AIMED TO COMPARE THE PERFORMANCE OF THREE PRE-TRAINING MODELS THAT HAVE RECENTLY ATTRACTED SIGNIFICANT ATTENTION AND TO DETERMINE WHICH MODEL IS MORE SUITABLE FOR PHI RECOGNITION. METHODS: WE COMPARED THE PHI RECOGNITION PERFORMANCE OF DEEP LEARNING MODELS USING THE I2B2 2014 DATASET. WE USED THE THREE PRE-TRAINING MODELS-NAMELY, BIDIRECTIONAL ENCODER REPRESENTATIONS FROM TRANSFORMERS (BERT), ROBUSTLY OPTIMIZED BERT PRE-TRAINING APPROACH (ROBERTA), AND XLNET (MODEL BUILT BASED ON TRANSFORMER-XL)-TO DETECT PHI. AFTER THE DATASET WAS TOKENIZED, IT WAS PROCESSED USING AN INSIDE-OUTSIDE-BEGINNING TAGGING SCHEME AND WORDPIECETOKENIZED TO PLACE IT INTO THESE MODELS. FURTHER, THE PHI RECOGNITION PERFORMANCE WAS INVESTIGATED USING BERT, ROBERTA, AND XLNET. RESULTS: COMPARING THE PHI RECOGNITION PERFORMANCE OF THE THREE MODELS, IT WAS CONFIRMED THAT XLNET HAD A SUPERIOR F1-SCORE OF 96.29%. IN ADDITION, WHEN CHECKING PHI ENTITY PERFORMANCE EVALUATION, ROBERTA AND XLNET SHOWED A 30% IMPROVEMENT IN PERFORMANCE COMPARED TO BERT. CONCLUSIONS: AMONG THE PRE-TRAINING MODELS USED IN THIS STUDY, XLNET EXHIBITED SUPERIOR PERFORMANCE BECAUSE WORD EMBEDDING WAS WELL CONSTRUCTED USING THE TWO-STREAM SELF-ATTENTION METHOD. IN ADDITION, COMPARED TO BERT, ROBERTA AND XLNET SHOWED SUPERIOR PERFORMANCE, INDICATING THAT THEY WERE MORE EFFECTIVE IN GRASPING THE CONTEXT.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
QUANTIFICATION OF GENDER BIAS AND SENTIMENT TOWARD POLITICAL LEADERS OVER 20 YEARS OF KENYAN NEWS USING NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING. BACKGROUND: DESPITE A 2010 KENYAN CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT LIMITING MEMBERS OF ELECTED PUBLIC BODIES TO < TWO-THIRDS OF THE SAME GENDER, ONLY 22 PERCENT OF THE 12TH PARLIAMENT MEMBERS INAUGURATED IN 2017 WERE WOMEN. INVESTIGATING GENDER BIAS IN THE MEDIA IS A USEFUL TOOL FOR UNDERSTANDING SOCIO-CULTURAL BARRIERS TO IMPLEMENTING LEGISLATION FOR GENDER EQUALITY. NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) METHODS, SUCH AS WORD EMBEDDING AND SENTIMENT ANALYSIS, CAN EFFICIENTLY QUANTIFY MEDIA BIASES AT A SCOPE PREVIOUSLY UNAVAILABLE IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES. METHODS: WE TRAINED GLOVE AND WORD2VEC WORD EMBEDDINGS ON TEXT FROM 1998 TO 2019 FROM KENYA'S DAILY NATION NEWSPAPER. WE MEASURED GENDER BIAS IN THESE EMBEDDINGS AND USED SENTIMENT ANALYSIS TO PREDICT QUANTITATIVE SENTIMENT SCORES FOR SENTENCES SURROUNDING FEMALE LEADER NAMES COMPARED TO MALE LEADER NAMES. RESULTS: BIAS IN LEADERSHIP WORDS FOR MEN AND WOMEN MEASURED FROM DAILY NATION WORD EMBEDDINGS CORRESPONDED TO TEMPORAL TRENDS IN MEN AND WOMEN'S PARTICIPATION IN POLITICAL LEADERSHIP (I.E., PARLIAMENTARY SEATS) USING GLOVE (CORRELATION 0.8936, P = 0.0067, R (2) = 0.799) AND WORD2VEC (CORRELATION 0.844, P = 0.0169, R (2) = 0.712) ALGORITHMS. WOMEN CONTINUE TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH DOMESTIC TERMS WHILE MEN CONTINUE TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH INFLUENCE TERMS, FOR BOTH REGULAR GENDER WORDS AND FEMALE AND MALE POLITICAL LEADERS' NAMES. MALE WORDS (E.G., HE, HIM, MAN) WERE MENTIONED 1.84 MILLION MORE TIMES THAN FEMALE WORDS FROM 1998 TO 2019. SENTIMENT ANALYSIS SHOWED AN INCREASE IN RELATIVE NEGATIVE SENTIMENT ASSOCIATED WITH FEMALE LEADERS (P = 0.0152) AND AN INCREASE IN POSITIVE SENTIMENT ASSOCIATED WITH MALE LEADERS OVER TIME (P = 0.0216). CONCLUSION: NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING IS A POWERFUL METHOD FOR GAINING INSIGHTS INTO AND QUANTIFYING TRENDS IN GENDER BIASES AND SENTIMENT IN NEWS MEDIA. WE FOUND EVIDENCE OF IMPROVEMENT IN GENDER EQUALITY BUT ALSO A BACKLASH FROM INCREASED FEMALE REPRESENTATION IN HIGH-LEVEL GOVERNMENTAL LEADERSHIP.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
QUANTIFYING DEPRESSION-RELATED LANGUAGE ON SOCIAL MEDIA DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. INTRODUCTION: THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAD CLEAR IMPACTS ON MENTAL HEALTH. SOCIAL MEDIA PRESENTS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ASSESSING MENTAL HEALTH AT THE POPULATION LEVEL. OBJECTIVES: 1) IDENTIFY AND DESCRIBE LANGUAGE USED ON SOCIAL MEDIA THAT IS ASSOCIATED WITH DISCOURSE ABOUT DEPRESSION. 2) DESCRIBE THE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN IDENTIFIED LANGUAGE AND COVID-19 INCIDENCE OVER TIME ACROSS SEVERAL GEOGRAPHIES. METHODS: WE CREATE A WORD EMBEDDING BASED ON THE POSTS IN REDDIT'S /R/DEPRESSION AND USE THIS WORD EMBEDDING TO TRAIN REPRESENTATIONS OF ACTIVE AUTHORS. WE CONTRAST THESE AUTHORS AGAINST A CONTROL GROUP AND EXTRACT KEYWORDS THAT CAPTURE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS. WE FILTER THESE KEYWORDS FOR FACE VALIDITY AND TO MATCH CHARACTER LIMITS OF AN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM, ELASTICSEARCH. WE RETRIEVE ALL GEO-TAGGED POSTS ON TWITTER FROM APRIL 2019 TO JUNE 2021 FROM SEATTLE, SYDNEY, MUMBAI, AND TORONTO. THE TWEETS ARE SCORED WITH BM25 USING THE KEYWORDS. WE CALL THIS SCORE RDD. WE COMPARE CHANGES IN AVERAGE SCORE OVER TIME WITH CASE COUNTS FROM THE PANDEMIC'S BEGINNING THROUGH JUNE 2021. RESULTS: WE OBSERVE A PATTERN IN RDD ACROSS ALL CITIES ANALYZED: THERE IS AN INCREASE IN RDD NEAR THE START OF THE PANDEMIC WHICH LEVELS OFF OVER TIME. HOWEVER, IN MUMBAI WE ALSO SEE AN INCREASE ALIGNED WITH A SECOND WAVE OF CASES. CONCLUSIONS: OUR RESULTS ARE CONCORDANT WITH OTHER STUDIES WHICH INDICATE THAT THE IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC ON MENTAL HEALTH WAS HIGHEST INITIALLY AND WAS FOLLOWED BY RECOVERY, LARGELY UNCHANGED BY SUBSEQUENT WAVES. HOWEVER, IN THE MUMBAI DATA WE OBSERVED A SUBSTANTIAL RISE IN RDD WITH A LARGE SECOND WAVE. OUR RESULTS INDICATE POSSIBLE UN-CAPTURED HETEROGENEITY ACROSS GEOGRAPHIES, AND POINT TO A NEED FOR A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THIS DIFFERENTIAL IMPACT ON MENTAL HEALTH.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
RADIOBERT: A DEEP LEARNING-BASED SYSTEM FOR MEDICAL REPORT GENERATION FROM CHEST X-RAY IMAGES USING CONTEXTUAL EMBEDDINGS. BACKGROUND: INCREASING NUMBER OF CHEST X-RAY (CXR) EXAMINATIONS IN RADIODIAGNOSIS DEPARTMENTS BURDENS RADIOLOGISTS' AND MAKES THE TIMELY GENERATION OF ACCURATE RADIOLOGICAL REPORTS HIGHLY CHALLENGING. AN AUTOMATIC RADIOLOGICAL REPORT GENERATION (ARRG) SYSTEM IS ENVISAGED TO GENERATE RADIOGRAPHIC REPORTS WITH MINIMAL HUMAN INTERVENTION, EASE RADIOLOGISTS' BURDEN, AND SMOOTHEN THE CLINICAL WORKFLOW. THE SUCCESS OF AN ARRG SYSTEM DEPENDS ON TWO CRITICAL FACTORS: I) QUALITY OF THE FEATURES EXTRACTED BY THE ARRG SYSTEM FROM THE CXR IMAGES, AND II) QUALITY OF THE LINGUISTIC EXPRESSION GENERATED BY THE ARRG SYSTEM DESCRIBING THE NORMALITIES AND ABNORMALITIES AS INDICATED BY THE EXTRACTED FEATURES. MOST OF THE EXISTING ARRG SYSTEMS MISERABLY FAIL DUE TO THE LATTER FACTOR AND DO NOT GENERATE CLINICALLY ACCEPTABLE REPORTS BECAUSE THEY IGNORE THE CONTEXTUAL IMPORTANCE OF THE MEDICAL TERMS. OBJECTIVES: THE ADVENT OF CONTEXTUAL WORD EMBEDDINGS, LIKE ELMO AND BERT, HAS REVOLUTIONIZED SEVERAL NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) TASKS. A CONTEXTUAL EMBEDDING REPRESENTS A WORD BASED ON ITS CONTEXT. THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THIS WORK IS TO DEVELOP AN ARRG SYSTEM THAT USES CONTEXTUAL WORD EMBEDDINGS TO GENERATE CLINICALLY ACCURATE REPORTS FROM CXR IMAGES. METHODS: WE PRESENT AN END-TO-END DEEP NEURAL NETWORK THAT USES CONTEXTUAL WORD REPRESENTATIONS FOR GENERATING CLINICALLY USEFUL RADIOLOGICAL REPORTS FROM CXR IMAGES. THE PROPOSED NETWORK, TERMED AS RADIOBERT, USES DISTILBERT FOR CONTEXTUAL WORD REPRESENTATION AND LEVERAGES TRANSFER LEARNING. ADDITIONALLY, DUE TO THE IMPORTANCE OF ABNORMAL OBSERVATIONS OVER THE NORMAL ONES, THE NETWORK REORDERS THE GENERATED SENTENCES BY APPLYING SENTIMENT ANALYSIS TO KEEP ABNORMAL DESCRIPTIONS ON THE TOP OF THE GENERATED REPORT. RESULTS: THE EMPIRICAL STUDY CONSISTING OF SEVERAL EXPERIMENTS PERFORMED ON THE OPENI DATASET INDICATES THAT CNN+HIERARCHICAL LSTM WITH DISTILBERT EMBEDDING IMPROVES THE BENCHMARK PERFORMANCE. WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ACHIEVE THE FOLLOWING PERFORMANCE SCORES: BLEU-1 = 0.772, BLEU-2 = 0.770, BLEU-3 = 0.768, BLEU-4 = 0.767, CIDER = 0.5563, AND ROUGE = 0.897. CONCLUSION: THE PROPOSED METHOD IMPROVES THE STATE-OF-THE-ART PERFORMANCE SCORES BY A SUBSTANTIAL MARGIN. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THE USE OF WORD EMBEDDINGS GENERATED BY DISTILBERT ENHANCES THE PERFORMANCE OF HIERARCHICAL LSTM FOR PRODUCING CLINICAL REPORTS BY SIGNIFICANT MARGIN.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
RADIOLOGY REPORT ANNOTATION USING INTELLIGENT WORD EMBEDDINGS: APPLIED TO MULTI-INSTITUTIONAL CHEST CT COHORT. WE PROPOSED AN UNSUPERVISED HYBRID METHOD - INTELLIGENT WORD EMBEDDING (IWE) THAT COMBINES NEURAL EMBEDDING METHOD WITH A SEMANTIC DICTIONARY MAPPING TECHNIQUE FOR CREATING A DENSE VECTOR REPRESENTATION OF UNSTRUCTURED RADIOLOGY REPORTS. WE APPLIED IWE TO GENERATE EMBEDDING OF CHEST CT RADIOLOGY REPORTS FROM TWO HEALTHCARE ORGANIZATIONS AND UTILIZED THE VECTOR REPRESENTATIONS TO SEMI-AUTOMATE REPORT CATEGORIZATION BASED ON CLINICALLY RELEVANT CATEGORIZATION RELATED TO THE DIAGNOSIS OF PULMONARY EMBOLISM (PE). WE BENCHMARK THE PERFORMANCE AGAINST A STATE-OF-THE-ART RULE-BASED TOOL, PEFINDER AND OUT-OF-THE-BOX WORD2VEC. ON THE STANFORD TEST SET, THE IWE MODEL ACHIEVED AVERAGE F1 SCORE 0.97, WHEREAS THE PEFINDER SCORED 0.9 AND THE ORIGINAL WORD2VEC SCORED 0.94. ON UPMC DATASET, THE IWE MODEL'S AVERAGE F1 SCORE WAS 0.94, WHEN THE PEFINDER SCORED 0.92 AND WORD2VEC SCORED 0.85. THE IWE MODEL HAD LOWEST GENERALIZATION ERROR WITH HIGHEST F1 SCORES. OF PARTICULAR INTEREST, THE IWE MODEL (TRAINED ON THE STANFORD DATASET) OUTPERFORMED PEFINDER ON THE UPMC DATASET WHICH WAS USED ORIGINALLY TO TAILOR THE PEFINDER MODEL.

DATASETS WITH PREDICTABILITY NORMS OF 393 PARTICIPANTS AND EYE-TRACKING DATA OF 37 PARTICIPANTS ARE AVAILABLE IN THE OSF REPOSITORY FOR THIS WORK (HTTPS://OSF.IO/9JXG3/).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORKS FOR CLASSIFYING RELATIONS IN CLINICAL NOTES. WE PROPOSED THE FIRST MODELS BASED ON RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORKS (MORE SPECIFICALLY LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY - LSTM) FOR CLASSIFYING RELATIONS FROM CLINICAL NOTES. WE TESTED OUR MODELS ON THE I2B2/VA RELATION CLASSIFICATION CHALLENGE DATASET. WE SHOWED THAT OUR SEGMENT LSTM MODEL, WITH ONLY WORD EMBEDDING FEATURE AND NO MANUAL FEATURE ENGINEERING, ACHIEVED A MICRO-AVERAGED F-MEASURE OF 0.661 FOR CLASSIFYING MEDICAL PROBLEM-TREATMENT RELATIONS, 0.800 FOR MEDICAL PROBLEM-TEST RELATIONS, AND 0.683 FOR MEDICAL PROBLEM-MEDICAL PROBLEM RELATIONS. THESE RESULTS ARE COMPARABLE TO THOSE OF THE STATE-OF-THE-ART SYSTEMS ON THE I2B2/VA RELATION CLASSIFICATION CHALLENGE. WE COMPARED THE SEGMENT LSTM MODEL WITH THE SENTENCE LSTM MODEL, AND DEMONSTRATED THE BENEFITS OF EXPLORING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CONCEPT TEXT AND CONTEXT TEXT, AND BETWEEN DIFFERENT CONTEXTUAL PARTS IN THE SENTENCE. WE ALSO EVALUATED THE IMPACT OF WORD EMBEDDING ON THE PERFORMANCE OF LSTM MODELS AND SHOWED THAT MEDICAL DOMAIN WORD EMBEDDING HELP IMPROVE THE RELATION CLASSIFICATION. THESE RESULTS SUPPORT THE USE OF LSTM MODELS FOR CLASSIFYING RELATIONS BETWEEN MEDICAL CONCEPTS, AS THEY SHOW COMPARABLE PERFORMANCE TO PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED SYSTEMS WHILE REQUIRING NO MANUAL FEATURE ENGINEERING.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
REDMED: EXTENDING DRUG LEXICONS FOR SOCIAL MEDIA APPLICATIONS. SOCIAL MEDIA HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A PROMISING POTENTIAL SOURCE OF INFORMATION FOR PHARMACOVIGILANCE. THE ADOPTION OF SOCIAL MEDIA DATA HAS BEEN HINDERED BY THE MASSIVE AND NOISY NATURE OF THE DATA. INITIAL ATTEMPTS TO USE SOCIAL MEDIA DATA HAVE RELIED ON EXACT TEXT MATCHES TO DRUGS OF INTEREST, AND THEREFORE SUFFER FROM THE GAP BETWEEN FORMAL DRUG LEXICONS AND THE INFORMAL NATURE OF SOCIAL MEDIA. THE REDDIT COMMENT ARCHIVE REPRESENTS AN IDEAL CORPUS FOR BRIDGING THIS GAP. WE TRAINED A WORD EMBEDDING MODEL, REDMED, TO FACILITATE THE IDENTIFICATION AND RETRIEVAL OF HEALTH ENTITIES FROM REDDIT DATA. WE COMPARE THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR MODEL TRAINED ON A CONSUMER-GENERATED CORPUS AGAINST PUBLICLY AVAILABLE MODELS TRAINED ON EXPERT-GENERATED CORPORA. OUR AUTOMATED CLASSIFICATION PIPELINE ACHIEVES AN ACCURACY OF 0.88 AND A SPECIFICITY OF >0.9 ACROSS FOUR DIFFERENT TERM CLASSES. OF ALL DRUG MENTIONS, AN AVERAGE OF 79% (+/-0.5%) WERE EXACT MATCHES TO A GENERIC OR TRADEMARK DRUG NAME, 14% (+/-0.5%) WERE MISSPELLINGS, 6.4% (+/-0.3%) WERE SYNONYMS, AND 0.13% (+/-0.05%) WERE PILL MARKS. WE FIND THAT OUR SYSTEM CAPTURES AN ADDITIONAL 20% OF MENTIONS; THESE WOULD HAVE BEEN MISSED BY APPROACHES THAT RELY SOLELY ON EXACT STRING MATCHES. WE PROVIDE A LEXICON OF MISSPELLINGS AND SYNONYMS FOR 2978 DRUGS AND A WORD EMBEDDING MODEL TRAINED ON A HEALTH-ORIENTED SUBSET OF REDDIT.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
REFINING ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS REPRESENTATION IN MANIFOLD SUBSPACE. BACKGROUND: ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS (EMR) CONTAIN DETAILED INFORMATION ABOUT PATIENT HEALTH. DEVELOPING AN EFFECTIVE REPRESENTATION MODEL IS OF GREAT SIGNIFICANCE FOR THE DOWNSTREAM APPLICATIONS OF EMR. HOWEVER, PROCESSING DATA DIRECTLY IS DIFFICULT BECAUSE EMR DATA HAS SUCH CHARACTERISTICS AS INCOMPLETENESS, UNSTRUCTURE AND REDUNDANCY. THEREFORE, PREPROCESS OF THE ORIGINAL DATA IS THE KEY STEP OF EMR DATA MINING. THE CLASSIC DISTRIBUTED WORD REPRESENTATIONS IGNORE THE GEOMETRIC FEATURE OF THE WORD VECTORS FOR THE REPRESENTATION OF EMR DATA, WHICH OFTEN UNDERESTIMATE THE SIMILARITIES BETWEEN SIMILAR WORDS AND OVERESTIMATE THE SIMILARITIES BETWEEN DISTANT WORDS. THIS RESULTS IN WORD SIMILARITY OBTAINED FROM EMBEDDING MODELS BEING INCONSISTENT WITH HUMAN JUDGMENT AND MUCH VALUABLE MEDICAL INFORMATION BEING LOST. RESULTS: IN THIS STUDY, WE PROPOSE A BIOMEDICAL WORD EMBEDDING FRAMEWORK BASED ON MANIFOLD SUBSPACE. OUR PROPOSED MODEL FIRST OBTAINS THE WORD VECTOR REPRESENTATIONS OF THE EMR DATA, AND THEN RE-EMBEDS THE WORD VECTOR IN THE MANIFOLD SUBSPACE. WE DEVELOP AN EFFICIENT OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM WITH NEIGHBORHOOD PRESERVING EMBEDDING BASED ON MANIFOLD OPTIMIZATION. TO VERIFY THE ALGORITHM PRESENTED IN THIS STUDY, WE PERFORM EXPERIMENTS ON INTRINSIC EVALUATION AND EXTERNAL CLASSIFICATION TASKS, AND THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS DEMONSTRATE ITS ADVANTAGES OVER OTHER BASELINE METHODS. CONCLUSIONS: MANIFOLD LEARNING SUBSPACE EMBEDDING CAN ENHANCE THE REPRESENTATION OF DISTRIBUTED WORD REPRESENTATIONS IN ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORD TEXTS. REDUCE THE DIFFICULTY FOR RESEARCHERS TO PROCESS UNSTRUCTURED ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORD TEXT DATA, WHICH HAS CERTAIN BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH VALUE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
RELATION EXTRACTION BETWEEN BACTERIA AND BIOTOPES FROM BIOMEDICAL TEXTS WITH ATTENTION MECHANISMS AND DOMAIN-SPECIFIC CONTEXTUAL REPRESENTATIONS. BACKGROUND: THE BACTERIA BIOTOPE (BB) TASK IS A BIOMEDICAL RELATION EXTRACTION (RE) THAT AIMS TO STUDY THE INTERACTION BETWEEN BACTERIA AND THEIR LOCATIONS. THIS TASK IS CONSIDERED TO PERTAIN TO FUNDAMENTAL KNOWLEDGE IN APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY. SOME PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS CONDUCTED THE STUDY BY APPLYING FEATURE-BASED MODELS; OTHERS HAVE PRESENTED DEEP-LEARNING-BASED MODELS SUCH AS CONVOLUTIONAL AND RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORKS USED WITH THE SHORTEST DEPENDENCY PATHS (SDPS). ALTHOUGH SDPS CONTAIN VALUABLE AND CONCISE INFORMATION, SOME PARTS OF CRUCIAL INFORMATION THAT IS REQUIRED TO DEFINE BACTERIAL LOCATION RELATIONSHIPS ARE OFTEN NEGLECTED. MOREOVER, THE TRADITIONAL WORD-EMBEDDING USED IN PREVIOUS STUDIES MAY SUFFER FROM WORD AMBIGUATION ACROSS LINGUISTIC CONTEXTS. RESULTS: HERE, WE PRESENT A DEEP LEARNING MODEL FOR BIOMEDICAL RE. THE MODEL INCORPORATES FEATURE COMBINATIONS OF SDPS AND FULL SENTENCES WITH VARIOUS ATTENTION MECHANISMS. WE ALSO USED PRE-TRAINED CONTEXTUAL REPRESENTATIONS BASED ON DOMAIN-SPECIFIC VOCABULARIES. TO ASSESS THE MODEL'S ROBUSTNESS, WE INTRODUCED A MEAN F1 SCORE ON MANY MODELS USING DIFFERENT RANDOM SEEDS. THE EXPERIMENTS WERE CONDUCTED ON THE STANDARD BB CORPUS IN BIONLP-ST'16. OUR EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS REVEALED THAT THE MODEL PERFORMED BETTER (IN TERMS OF BOTH MAXIMUM AND AVERAGE F1 SCORES; 60.77% AND 57.63%, RESPECTIVELY) COMPARED WITH OTHER EXISTING MODELS. CONCLUSIONS: WE DEMONSTRATED THAT OUR PROPOSED CONTRIBUTIONS TO THIS TASK CAN BE USED TO EXTRACT RICH LEXICAL, SYNTACTIC, AND SEMANTIC FEATURES THAT EFFECTIVELY BOOST THE MODEL'S PERFORMANCE. MOREOVER, WE ANALYZED THE TRADE-OFF BETWEEN PRECISION AND RECALL TO CHOOSE THE PROPER CUT-OFF TO USE IN REAL-WORLD APPLICATIONS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
RELATION EXTRACTION IN BIOMEDICAL TEXTS BASED ON MULTI-HEAD ATTENTION MODEL WITH SYNTACTIC DEPENDENCY FEATURE: MODELING STUDY. BACKGROUND: WITH THE RAPID EXPANSION OF BIOMEDICAL LITERATURE, BIOMEDICAL INFORMATION EXTRACTION HAS ATTRACTED INCREASING ATTENTION FROM RESEARCHERS. IN PARTICULAR, RELATION EXTRACTION BETWEEN 2 ENTITIES IS A LONG-TERM RESEARCH TOPIC. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY AIMED TO PERFORM 2 MULTICLASS RELATION EXTRACTION TASKS OF BIOMEDICAL NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING WORKSHOP 2019 OPEN SHARED TASKS: RELATION EXTRACTION OF BACTERIA-BIOTOPE (BB-REL) TASK AND BINARY RELATION EXTRACTION OF PLANT SEED DEVELOPMENT (SEEDEV-BINARY) TASK. IN ESSENCE, THESE 2 TASKS ARE AIMED AT EXTRACTING THE RELATION BETWEEN ANNOTATED ENTITY PAIRS FROM BIOMEDICAL TEXTS, WHICH IS A CHALLENGING PROBLEM. METHODS: TRADITIONAL RESEARCH METHODS ADOPTED FEATURE- OR KERNEL-BASED METHODS AND ACHIEVED GOOD PERFORMANCE. FOR THESE TASKS, WE PROPOSE A DEEP LEARNING MODEL BASED ON A COMBINATION OF SEVERAL DISTRIBUTED FEATURES, SUCH AS DOMAIN-SPECIFIC WORD EMBEDDING, PART-OF-SPEECH EMBEDDING, ENTITY-TYPE EMBEDDING, DISTANCE EMBEDDING, AND POSITION EMBEDDING. THE MULTI-HEAD ATTENTION MECHANISM IS USED TO EXTRACT THE GLOBAL SEMANTIC FEATURES OF AN ENTIRE SENTENCE. MEANWHILE, WE INTRODUCED A DEPENDENCY-TYPE FEATURE AND THE SHORTEST DEPENDENCY PATH CONNECTING 2 CANDIDATE ENTITIES IN THE SYNTACTIC DEPENDENCY GRAPH TO ENRICH THE FEATURE REPRESENTATION. RESULTS: EXPERIMENTS SHOW THAT OUR PROPOSED MODEL HAS EXCELLENT PERFORMANCE IN BIOMEDICAL RELATION EXTRACTION, ACHIEVING F1 SCORES OF 65.56% AND 38.04% ON THE TEST SETS OF THE BB-REL AND SEEDEV-BINARY TASKS. ESPECIALLY IN THE SEEDEV-BINARY TASK, THE F1 SCORE OF OUR MODEL IS SUPERIOR TO THAT OF OTHER EXISTING MODELS AND ACHIEVES STATE-OF-THE-ART PERFORMANCE. CONCLUSIONS: WE DEMONSTRATED THAT THE MULTI-HEAD ATTENTION MECHANISM CAN LEARN RELEVANT SYNTACTIC AND SEMANTIC FEATURES IN DIFFERENT REPRESENTATION SUBSPACES AND DIFFERENT POSITIONS TO EXTRACT COMPREHENSIVE FEATURE REPRESENTATION. MOREOVER, SYNTACTIC DEPENDENCY FEATURES CAN IMPROVE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE MODEL BY LEARNING DEPENDENCY RELATION BETWEEN THE ENTITIES IN BIOMEDICAL TEXTS.

THIS STUDY PROPOSES AN END-TO-END IMAGE DESCRIPTION GENERATION MODEL BASED ON WORD EMBEDDING TECHNOLOGY TO REALISE THE CLASSIFICATION AND IDENTIFICATION OF POPULUS EUPHRATICA AND TAMARIX IN COMPLEX REMOTE SENSING IMAGES BY PROVIDING DESCRIPTIONS IN PRECISE AND CONCISE NATURAL SENTENCES. FIRST, CATEGORY AMBIGUITY OVER LARGE-SCALE REGIONS IN REMOTE SENSING IMAGES IS ADDRESSED BY INTRODUCING THE CO-OCCURRENCE MATRIX AND GLOBAL VECTORS FOR WORD REPRESENTATION TO GENERATE THE WORD VECTOR FEATURES OF THE OBJECT TO BE IDENTIFIED. SECOND, A NEW MULTI-LEVEL END-TO-END MODEL IS EMPLOYED TO FURTHER DESCRIBE THE CONTENT OF REMOTE SENSING IMAGES AND TO BETTER ADVANCE THE DESCRIPTION TASKS FOR P. EUPHRATICA AND TAMARIX IN REMOTE SENSING IMAGES. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS REVEAL THAT THE NATURAL LANGUAGE SENTENCES GENERATED USING THIS METHOD CAN BETTER DESCRIBE P. EUPHRATICA AND TAMARIX IN REMOTE SENSING IMAGES COMPARED WITH CONVENTIONAL DEEP LEARNING METHODS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
REPRESENTATION OF JEWS AND ANTI-JEWISH BIAS IN 19TH CENTURY FRENCH PUBLIC DISCOURSE: DISTANT AND CLOSE READING. WE EXPLORE THROUGH THE LENS OF DISTANT READING THE EVOLUTION OF DISCOURSE ON JEWS IN FRANCE DURING THE XIX CENTURY. WE ANALYZE A LARGE TEXTUAL CORPUS INCLUDING HETEROGENEOUS SOURCES-LITERARY WORKS, PERIODICALS, SONGS, ESSAYS, HISTORICAL NARRATIVES-TO TRACE HOW JEWS ARE ASSOCIATED TO DIFFERENT SEMANTIC DOMAINS, AND HOW SUCH ASSOCIATIONS SHIFT OVER TIME. OUR ANALYSIS DEALS WITH THREE KEY ASPECTS OF SUCH CHANGES: THE OVERALL TRANSFORMATION OF EMBEDDING SPACES, THE TRAJECTORIES OF WORD ASSOCIATIONS, AND THE COMPARATIVE PROJECTION OF DIFFERENT RELIGIOUS GROUPS OVER DIFFERENT, HISTORICALLY RELEVANT SEMANTIC DIMENSIONS OR STREAMS OF DISCOURSE. THIS ALLOWS TO SHOW CHANGES IN THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN WORDS AND SEMANTIC DOMAINS (REFERRING E.G. TO ECONOMIC AND MORAL BEHAVIORS), THE EVOLUTION OF STEREOTYPES, AND THE DYNAMICS OF BIAS OVER A LONG TIME SPAN CHARACTERIZED BY MAJOR HISTORICAL TRANSFORMATIONS. WE SUGGEST THAT THE ANALYSIS OF LARGE TEXTUAL CORPORA CAN BE FRUITFULLY USED IN A DIALOGUE WITH MORE TRADITIONAL CLOSE READING APPROACHES-BY POINTING TO OPPORTUNITIES OF IN-DEPTH ANALYSES THAT MOBILIZE MORE QUALITATIVE APPROACHES AND A DETAILED INSPECTION OF THE SOURCES THAT DISTANT READING INEVITABLY TENDS TO AGGREGATE. WE OFFER A SHORT EXAMPLE OF SUCH A DIALOGUE BETWEEN DIFFERENT APPROACHES IN OUR DISCUSSION OF THE SECOND EMPIRE TRANSFORMATIONS, WHERE WE MOBILIZE THE HISTORIAN'S TOOLS TO START DISENTANGLING THE COMPLEX INTERACTIONS BETWEEN CHANGES IN FRENCH SOCIETY, THE NATURE OF SOURCES, AND REPRESENTATIONS OF JEWS. WHILE OUR EXAMPLE IS LIMITED IN SCOPE, WE FORESEE LARGE POTENTIAL PAYOFFS IN THE COOPERATIVE INTERACTION BETWEEN DISTANT AND CLOSE READING.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
REPRESENTING MULTIWORD CHEMICAL TERMS THROUGH PHRASE-LEVEL PREPROCESSING AND WORD EMBEDDING. IN RECENT YEARS, DATA-DRIVEN METHODS AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE HAVE BEEN WIDELY USED IN CHEMOINFORMATIC AND MATERIAL INFORMATICS DOMAINS, FOR WHICH THE SUCCESS IS CRITICALLY DETERMINED BY THE AVAILABILITY OF TRAINING DATA WITH GOOD QUALITY AND LARGE QUANTITY. A POTENTIAL APPROACH TO BREAK THIS BOTTLENECK IS BY LEVERAGING THE CHEMICAL LITERATURE SUCH AS PAPERS AND PATENTS AS ALTERNATIVE DATA RESOURCES TO HIGH THROUGHPUT EXPERIMENTS AND SIMULATION. COMPARED TO OTHER DOMAINS WHERE NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING TECHNIQUES HAVE ESTABLISHED SUCCESSES, THE CHEMICAL LITERATURE CONTAINS A LARGE PORTION OF PHRASES OF MULTIPLE WORDS THAT CREATE ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES FOR ACCURATE IDENTIFICATION AND REPRESENTATION. HERE, WE INTRODUCE A CHEMISTRY DOMAIN SUITABLE APPROACH TO IDENTIFY MULTIWORD CHEMICAL TERMS AND TRAIN WORD REPRESENTATIONS AT THE PHRASE LEVEL. THROUGH A SERIES OF SPECIAL-DESIGNED EXPERIMENTS, WE DEMONSTRATE THAT OUR MULTIWORD IDENTIFYING AND REPRESENTING METHOD EFFECTIVELY AND ACCURATELY IDENTIFIES MULTIWORD CHEMICAL TERMS FROM 119, 166 CHEMICAL PATENTS AND IS MORE ROBUST AND PRECISE TO PRESERVE THE SEMANTIC MEANING OF CHEMICAL PHRASES COMPARED TO THE CONVENTIONAL APPROACH, WHICH REPRESENTS CONSTITUENT SINGLE WORDS FIRST AND COMBINE THEM AFTERWARD. BECAUSE THE ACCURATE REPRESENTATION OF CHEMICAL TERMS IS THE FIRST AND ESSENTIAL STEP TO PROVIDE LEARNING FEATURES FOR DOWNSTREAM NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING TASKS, OUR RESULTS PAVE THE ROAD TO UTILIZE THE LARGE VOLUME OF CHEMICAL LITERATURE IN FUTURE DATA-DRIVEN STUDIES.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
REPRODUCIBILITY DATASET FOR A LARGE EXPERIMENTAL SURVEY ON WORD EMBEDDINGS AND ONTOLOGY-BASED METHODS FOR WORD SIMILARITY. THIS DATA ARTICLE INTRODUCES A REPRODUCIBILITY DATASET WITH THE AIM OF ALLOWING THE EXACT REPLICATION OF ALL EXPERIMENTS, RESULTS AND DATA TABLES INTRODUCED IN OUR COMPANION PAPER (LASTRA-DIAZ ET AL., 2019), WHICH INTRODUCES THE LARGEST EXPERIMENTAL SURVEY ON ONTOLOGY-BASED SEMANTIC SIMILARITY METHODS AND WORD EMBEDDINGS (WE) FOR WORD SIMILARITY REPORTED IN THE LITERATURE. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ALL OUR EXPERIMENTS, AS WELL AS THE GATHERING OF ALL RAW DATA DERIVED FROM THEM, WAS BASED ON THE SOFTWARE IMPLEMENTATION AND EVALUATION OF ALL METHODS IN HESML LIBRARY (LASTRA-DIAZ ET AL., 2017), AND THEIR SUBSEQUENT RECORDING WITH REPROZIP (CHIRIGATI ET AL., 2016). RAW DATA IS MADE UP BY A COLLECTION OF DATA FILES GATHERING THE RAW WORD-SIMILARITY VALUES RETURNED BY EACH METHOD FOR EACH WORD PAIR EVALUATED IN ANY BENCHMARK. RAW DATA FILES WERE PROCESSED BY RUNNING A R-LANGUAGE SCRIPT WITH THE AIM OF COMPUTING ALL EVALUATION METRICS REPORTED IN (LASTRA-DIAZ ET AL., 2019), SUCH AS PEARSON AND SPEARMAN CORRELATION, HARMONIC SCORE AND STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE P-VALUES, AS WELL AS TO GENERATE AUTOMATICALLY ALL DATA TABLES SHOWN IN OUR COMPANION PAPER. OUR DATASET PROVIDES ALL INPUT DATA FILES, RESOURCES AND COMPLEMENTARY SOFTWARE TOOLS TO REPRODUCE FROM SCRATCH ALL OUR EXPERIMENTAL DATA, STATISTICAL ANALYSIS AND REPORTED DATA. FINALLY, OUR REPRODUCIBILITY DATASET PROVIDES A SELF-CONTAINED EXPERIMENTATION PLATFORM WHICH ALLOWS TO RUN NEW WORD SIMILARITY BENCHMARKS BY SETTING UP NEW EXPERIMENTS INCLUDING OTHER UNCONSIDERED METHODS OR WORD SIMILARITY BENCHMARKS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
RLAS-BIABC: A REINFORCEMENT LEARNING-BASED ANSWER SELECTION USING THE BERT MODEL BOOSTED BY AN IMPROVED ABC ALGORITHM. ANSWER SELECTION (AS) IS A CRITICAL SUBTASK OF THE OPEN-DOMAIN QUESTION ANSWERING (QA) PROBLEM. THE PRESENT PAPER PROPOSES A METHOD CALLED RLAS-BIABC FOR AS, WHICH IS ESTABLISHED ON ATTENTION MECHANISM-BASED LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY (LSTM) AND THE BIDIRECTIONAL ENCODER REPRESENTATIONS FROM TRANSFORMERS (BERT) WORD EMBEDDING, ENRICHED BY AN IMPROVED ARTIFICIAL BEE COLONY (ABC) ALGORITHM FOR PRETRAINING AND A REINFORCEMENT LEARNING-BASED ALGORITHM FOR TRAINING BACKPROPAGATION (BP) ALGORITHM. BERT CAN BE COMPRISED IN DOWNSTREAM WORK AND FINE-TUNED AS A UNITED TASK-SPECIFIC ARCHITECTURE, AND THE PRETRAINED BERT MODEL CAN GRAB DIFFERENT LINGUISTIC EFFECTS. EXISTING ALGORITHMS TYPICALLY TRAIN THE AS MODEL WITH POSITIVE-NEGATIVE PAIRS FOR A TWO-CLASS CLASSIFIER. A POSITIVE PAIR CONTAINS A QUESTION AND A GENUINE ANSWER, WHILE A NEGATIVE ONE INCLUDES A QUESTION AND A FAKE ANSWER. THE OUTPUT SHOULD BE ONE FOR POSITIVE AND ZERO FOR NEGATIVE PAIRS. TYPICALLY, NEGATIVE PAIRS ARE MORE THAN POSITIVE, LEADING TO AN IMBALANCED CLASSIFICATION THAT DRASTICALLY REDUCES SYSTEM PERFORMANCE. TO DEAL WITH IT, WE DEFINE CLASSIFICATION AS A SEQUENTIAL DECISION-MAKING PROCESS IN WHICH THE AGENT TAKES A SAMPLE AT EACH STEP AND CLASSIFIES IT. FOR EACH CLASSIFICATION OPERATION, THE AGENT RECEIVES A REWARD, IN WHICH THE PRIZE OF THE MAJORITY CLASS IS LESS THAN THE REWARD OF THE MINORITY CLASS. ULTIMATELY, THE AGENT FINDS THE OPTIMAL VALUE FOR THE POLICY WEIGHTS. WE INITIALIZE THE POLICY WEIGHTS WITH THE IMPROVED ABC ALGORITHM. THE INITIAL VALUE TECHNIQUE CAN PREVENT PROBLEMS SUCH AS GETTING STUCK IN THE LOCAL OPTIMUM. ALTHOUGH ABC SERVES WELL IN MOST TASKS, THERE IS STILL A WEAKNESS IN THE ABC ALGORITHM THAT DISREGARDS THE FITNESS OF RELATED PAIRS OF INDIVIDUALS IN DISCOVERING A NEIGHBORING FOOD SOURCE POSITION. THEREFORE, THIS PAPER ALSO PROPOSES A MUTUAL LEARNING TECHNIQUE THAT MODIFIES THE PRODUCED CANDIDATE FOOD SOURCE WITH THE HIGHER FITNESS BETWEEN TWO INDIVIDUALS SELECTED BY A MUTUAL LEARNING FACTOR. WE TESTED OUR MODEL ON THREE DATASETS, LEGALQA, TRECQA, AND WIKIQA, AND THE RESULTS SHOW THAT RLAS-BIABC CAN BE RECOGNIZED AS A STATE-OF-THE-ART METHOD.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
RUMOR DETECTION IN SOCIAL NETWORK BASED ON USER, CONTENT AND LEXICAL FEATURES. EMERGENCE IN THE SOCIAL NETWORK LEADS TO THE EXTENSIVE AND FASTER DIFFUSION OF NEWS THAN CONVENTIONAL NEWS CHANNELS. VERIFICATION OF DATA IS CHALLENGING DUE TO MASSIVE INFORMATION ON A SOCIAL NETWORK. UNVERIFIED INFORMATION CAN BE A RUMOR OR FAKE NEWS THAT CAUSES DAMAGE TO AN INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS, REVEALING THE HARMFUL IMPACT ON HUMANITY. THEREFORE, IT IS VITAL TO COMBAT RUMOR DIFFUSION TO MINIMIZE THE ADVERSE EFFECTS ON SOCIETY. DESPITE VIGOROUS EFFORTS TO DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE, RESEARCHERS MAINLY FOCUSSED ON TEMPORAL DYNAMICS OF POSTS AND OTHER FEATURES LIKE A USER, NETWORK, CONTENT-BASED, WHICH DEMONSTRATE A MODERATE ACCURACY. THE TIME SERIES FEATURES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH AN EVENT THAT SUPPRESSES THE OTHER QUALITY FEATURES RELATED TO EACH POST. THERE IS A SCOPE FOR IMPROVEMENT IN THE ACCURACY, SO THIS PAPER FOCUSES ON POST-WISE FEATURES SUCH AS USER-BASED, CONTENT-BASED AND LEXICAL-BASED FEATURES ALONG WITH POST SEQUENCES. WE PROPOSED A FRAMEWORK THAT USES VARIOUS ESSENTIAL FEATURES AND COMBINES TWO DEEP LEARNING MODELS. WORD EMBEDDING IS UTILIZED WITH BIDIRECTIONAL LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY (BILSTM) AND COMBINED WITH POST-WISE FEATURES USING A MULTILAYER PERCEPTRON (MLP), WHICH IMPROVES ACCURACY. THE EXPERIMENTS ON THE REAL-WORLD DATASET OF TWITTER DEMONSTRATE A NOTABLE IMPROVEMENT IN ACCURACY COMPARED TO STATE-OF-THE-ART APPROACHES.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
S2DV: CONVERTING SMILES TO A DRUG VECTOR FOR PREDICTING THE ACTIVITY OF ANTI-HBV SMALL MOLECULES. IN THE PAST FEW DECADES, CHRONIC HEPATITIS B CAUSED BY HEPATITIS B VIRUS (HBV) HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MOST SERIOUS DISEASES TO HUMAN HEALTH. THE DEVELOPMENT OF INNOVATIVE SYSTEMS IS ESSENTIAL FOR PREVENTING THE COMPLEX PATHOGENESIS OF HEPATITIS B AND REDUCING SIDE EFFECTS CAUSED BY DRUGS. HBV INHIBITORY DRUGS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED THROUGH VARIOUS COMPOUNDS, AND THEY ARE OFTEN LIMITED BY ROUTINE EXPERIMENTAL SCREENING AND DELAY DRUG DEVELOPMENT. MORE RECENTLY, VIRTUAL SCREENING OF COMPOUNDS HAS GRADUALLY BEEN USED IN DRUG RESEARCH WITH STRONG COMPUTATIONAL CAPABILITY AND IS FURTHER APPLIED IN ANTI-HBV DRUG SCREENING, THUS FACILITATING A RELIABLE DRUG SCREENING PROCESS. HOWEVER, THE LACK OF STRUCTURAL INFORMATION IN TRADITIONAL COMPOUND ANALYSIS IS AN IMPORTANT HURDLE FOR UNSATISFACTORY EFFICIENCY IN DRUG SCREENING. HERE, A NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING TECHNIQUE WAS ADOPTED TO ANALYZE COMPOUND SIMPLIFIED MOLECULAR INPUT LINE ENTRY SYSTEM STRINGS. BY USING THE TARGETED OPTIMIZED WORD2VEC MODEL FOR PRETRAINING, WE CAN ACCURATELY REPRESENT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE COMPOUND AND ITS SUBSTRUCTURE. THE MACHINE LEARNING MODEL BASED ON TRAINING RESULTS CAN EFFECTIVELY PREDICT THE INHIBITORY EFFECT OF COMPOUNDS ON HBV AND LIVER TOXICITY. THE RELIABILITY OF THE MODEL IS VERIFIED BY THE RESULTS OF WET-LAB EXPERIMENTS. IN ADDITION, A TOOL HAS BEEN PUBLISHED TO PREDICT POTENTIAL COMPOUNDS. HENCE, THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES A NEW PERSPECTIVE ON THE PREDICTION OF COMPOUND PROPERTIES FOR ANTI-HBV DRUGS THAT CAN HELP IMPROVE HEPATITIS B DIAGNOSIS AND FURTHER DEVELOP HUMAN HEALTH IN THE FUTURE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
SCALING HUMAN-OBJECT INTERACTION RECOGNITION IN THE VIDEO THROUGH ZERO-SHOT LEARNING. RECOGNITION OF HUMAN ACTIVITIES IS AN ESSENTIAL FIELD IN COMPUTER VISION. THE MOST HUMAN ACTIVITY CONSISTS OF THE INTERACTION BETWEEN HUMANS AND OBJECTS. MANY SUCCESSFUL WORKS HAVE BEEN DONE ON HUMAN-OBJECT INTERACTION (HOI) RECOGNITION AND ACHIEVED ACCEPTABLE RESULTS IN RECENT YEARS. STILL, THEY ARE FULLY SUPERVISED AND NEED TO TRAIN LABELED DATA FOR ALL HOIS. DUE TO THE ENORMOUS SPACE OF HUMAN-OBJECT INTERACTIONS, LISTING AND PROVIDING THE TRAINING DATA FOR ALL POSSIBLE CATEGORIES IS COSTLY AND IMPRACTICAL. WE PROPOSE AN APPROACH FOR SCALING HUMAN-OBJECT INTERACTION RECOGNITION IN VIDEO DATA THROUGH THE ZERO-SHOT LEARNING TECHNIQUE TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. OUR METHOD RECOGNIZES A VERB AND AN OBJECT FROM THE VIDEO AND MAKES AN HOI CLASS. RECOGNITION OF THE VERBS AND OBJECTS INSTEAD OF HOIS ALLOWS IDENTIFYING A NEW COMBINATION OF VERBS AND OBJECTS. SO, A NEW HOI CLASS CAN BE IDENTIFIED, WHICH IS NOT SEEN BY THE RECOGNIZER SYSTEM. WE INTRODUCE A NEURAL NETWORK ARCHITECTURE THAT CAN UNDERSTAND AND REPRESENT THE VIDEO DATA. THE PROPOSED SYSTEM LEARNS VERBS AND OBJECTS FROM AVAILABLE TRAINING DATA AT THE TRAINING PHASE AND CAN IDENTIFY THE VERB-OBJECT PAIRS IN A VIDEO AT TEST TIME. SO, THE SYSTEM CAN IDENTIFY THE HOI CLASS WITH DIFFERENT COMBINATIONS OF OBJECTS AND VERBS. ALSO, WE PROPOSE TO USE LATERAL INFORMATION FOR COMBINING THE VERBS AND THE OBJECTS TO MAKE VALID VERB-OBJECT PAIRS. IT HELPS TO PREVENT THE DETECTION OF RARE AND PROBABLY WRONG HOIS. THE LATERAL INFORMATION COMES FROM WORD EMBEDDING TECHNIQUES. FURTHERMORE, WE PROPOSE A NEW FEATURE AGGREGATION METHOD FOR AGGREGATING EXTRACTED HIGH-LEVEL FEATURES FROM VIDEO FRAMES BEFORE FEEDING THEM TO THE CLASSIFIER. WE ILLUSTRATE THAT THIS FEATURE AGGREGATION METHOD IS MORE EFFECTIVE FOR ACTIONS THAT INCLUDE MULTIPLE SUBACTIONS. WE EVALUATED OUR SYSTEM BY RECENTLY INTRODUCED CHARADES CHALLENGEABLE DATASET, WHICH HAS LOTS OF HOI CATEGORIES IN VIDEOS. WE SHOW THAT OUR PROPOSED SYSTEM CAN DETECT UNSEEN HOI CLASSES IN ADDITION TO THE ACCEPTABLE RECOGNITION OF SEEN TYPES. THEREFORE, THE NUMBER OF CLASSES IDENTIFIABLE BY THE SYSTEM IS GREATER THAN THE NUMBER OF CLASSES USED FOR TRAINING.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
SDN2GO: AN INTEGRATED DEEP LEARNING MODEL FOR PROTEIN FUNCTION PREDICTION. THE ASSIGNMENT OF FUNCTION TO PROTEINS AT A LARGE SCALE IS ESSENTIAL FOR UNDERSTANDING THE MOLECULAR MECHANISM OF LIFE. HOWEVER, ONLY A VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THE MORE THAN 179 MILLION PROTEINS IN UNIPROTKB HAVE GENE ONTOLOGY (GO) ANNOTATIONS SUPPORTED BY EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE. IN THIS PAPER, WE PROPOSED AN INTEGRATED DEEP-LEARNING-BASED CLASSIFICATION MODEL, NAMED SDN2GO, TO PREDICT PROTEIN FUNCTIONS. SDN2GO APPLIES CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS TO LEARN AND EXTRACT FEATURES FROM SEQUENCES, PROTEIN DOMAINS, AND KNOWN PPI NETWORKS, AND THEN UTILIZES A WEIGHT CLASSIFIER TO INTEGRATE THESE FEATURES AND ACHIEVE ACCURATE PREDICTIONS OF GO TERMS. WE CONSTRUCTED THE TRAINING SET AND THE INDEPENDENT TEST SET ACCORDING TO THE TIME-DELAYED PRINCIPLE OF THE CRITICAL ASSESSMENT OF FUNCTION ANNOTATION (CAFA) AND COMPARED IT WITH TWO HIGHLY COMPETITIVE METHODS AND THE CLASSIC BLAST METHOD ON THE INDEPENDENT TEST SET. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT OUR METHOD OUTPERFORMS OTHERS ON EACH SUB-ONTOLOGY OF GO. WE ALSO INVESTIGATED THE PERFORMANCE OF USING PROTEIN DOMAIN INFORMATION. WE LEARNED FROM THE NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) TO PROCESS DOMAIN INFORMATION AND PRE-TRAINED A DEEP LEARNING SUB-MODEL TO EXTRACT THE COMPREHENSIVE FEATURES OF DOMAINS. THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT THE DOMAIN FEATURES WE OBTAINED ARE MUCH IMPROVED THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR MODEL. OUR DEEP LEARNING MODELS TOGETHER WITH THE DATA PRE-PROCESSING SCRIPTS ARE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE AS AN OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE AT HTTPS://GITHUB.COM/CHARRICK/SDN2GO.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
SEARCH TERM IDENTIFICATION METHODS FOR COMPUTATIONAL HEALTH COMMUNICATION: WORD EMBEDDING AND NETWORK APPROACH FOR HEALTH CONTENT ON YOUTUBE. BACKGROUND: COMMON METHODS FOR EXTRACTING CONTENT IN HEALTH COMMUNICATION RESEARCH TYPICALLY INVOLVE USING A SET OF WELL-ESTABLISHED QUERIES, OFTEN NAMES OF MEDICAL PROCEDURES OR DISEASES, THAT ARE OFTEN TECHNICAL OR RARELY USED IN THE PUBLIC DISCUSSION OF HEALTH TOPICS. ALTHOUGH THESE METHODS PRODUCE HIGH RECALL (IE, RETRIEVE HIGHLY RELEVANT CONTENT), THEY TEND TO OVERLOOK HEALTH MESSAGES THAT FEATURE COLLOQUIAL LANGUAGE AND LAYPERSON VOCABULARIES ON SOCIAL MEDIA. GIVEN HOW SUCH MESSAGES COULD CONTAIN MISINFORMATION OR OBSCURE CONTENT THAT CIRCUMVENTS OFFICIAL MEDICAL CONCEPTS, CORRECTLY IDENTIFYING (AND ANALYZING) THEM IS CRUCIAL TO THE STUDY OF USER-GENERATED HEALTH CONTENT ON SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS. OBJECTIVE: HEALTH COMMUNICATION SCHOLARS WOULD BENEFIT FROM A RETRIEVAL PROCESS THAT GOES BEYOND THE USE OF STANDARD TERMINOLOGIES AS SEARCH QUERIES. MOTIVATED BY THIS, THIS STUDY AIMS TO PUT FORWARD A SEARCH TERM IDENTIFICATION METHOD TO IMPROVE THE RETRIEVAL OF USER-GENERATED HEALTH CONTENT ON SOCIAL MEDIA. WE FOCUSED ON CANCER SCREENING TESTS AS A SUBJECT AND YOUTUBE AS A PLATFORM CASE STUDY. METHODS: WE RETRIEVED YOUTUBE VIDEOS USING CANCER SCREENING PROCEDURES (COLONOSCOPY, FECAL OCCULT BLOOD TEST, MAMMOGRAM, AND PAP TEST) AS SEED QUERIES. WE THEN TRAINED WORD EMBEDDING MODELS USING TEXT FEATURES FROM THESE VIDEOS TO IDENTIFY THE NEAREST NEIGHBOR TERMS THAT ARE SEMANTICALLY SIMILAR TO CANCER SCREENING TESTS IN COLLOQUIAL LANGUAGE. RETRIEVING MORE YOUTUBE VIDEOS FROM THE TOP NEIGHBOR TERMS, WE CODED A SAMPLE OF 150 RANDOM VIDEOS FROM EACH TERM FOR RELEVANCE. WE THEN USED TEXT MINING TO EXAMINE THE NEW CONTENT RETRIEVED FROM THESE VIDEOS AND NETWORK ANALYSIS TO INSPECT THE RELATIONS BETWEEN THE NEWLY RETRIEVED VIDEOS AND VIDEOS FROM THE SEED QUERIES. RESULTS: THE TOP TERMS WITH SEMANTIC SIMILARITIES TO CANCER SCREENING TESTS WERE IDENTIFIED VIA WORD EMBEDDING MODELS. TEXT MINING ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT THE 5 NEAREST NEIGHBOR TERMS RETRIEVED CONTENT THAT WAS NOVEL AND CONTEXTUALLY DIVERSE, BEYOND THE CONTENT RETRIEVED FROM CANCER SCREENING CONCEPTS ALONE. RESULTS FROM NETWORK ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT THE NEWLY RETRIEVED VIDEOS HAD AT LEAST ONE TOTAL DEGREE OF CONNECTION (SUM OF INDEGREE AND OUTDEGREE) WITH SEED VIDEOS ACCORDING TO YOUTUBE RELATEDNESS MEASURES. CONCLUSIONS: WE DEMONSTRATED A RETRIEVAL TECHNIQUE TO IMPROVE RECALL AND MINIMIZE PRECISION LOSS, WHICH CAN BE EXTENDED TO VARIOUS HEALTH TOPICS ON YOUTUBE, A POPULAR VIDEO-SHARING SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM. WE DISCUSSED HOW HEALTH COMMUNICATION SCHOLARS CAN APPLY THE TECHNIQUE TO INSPECT THE PERFORMANCE OF THE RETRIEVAL STRATEGY BEFORE INVESTING HUMAN CODING RESOURCES AND OUTLINED SUGGESTIONS ON HOW SUCH A TECHNIQUE CAN BE EXTENDED TO OTHER HEALTH CONTEXTS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
SEEDS: SAMPLING-ENHANCED EMBEDDINGS. FINDING A DESIRABLE SAMPLING ESTIMATOR HAS A PROFOUND IMPACT ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF STATIC WORD EMBEDDING MODELS, SUCH AS CONTINUE-BAG-OF-WORDS (CBOW) AND SKIP GRAM (SG), WHICH HAVE BEEN GENERALLY ACCEPTED AS POPULAR LOW-RESOURCE ALGORITHMS TO GENERATE TASK-AGNOSTIC WORD REPRESENTATIONS. DUE TO THE PREVALENCE OF LARGE-SCALE PRETRAINED MODELS, LESS ATTENTION HAS BEEN PAID TO THESE STATIC MODELS IN THE RECENT YEARS. HOWEVER, COMPARED WITH THE DYNAMIC EMBEDDING MODELS (E.G., BERT), THESE STATIC MODELS ARE STRAIGHTFORWARD TO INTERPRET, COST EFFECTIVE TO TRAIN, AND OUT-OF-BOX TO DEPLOY, THUS ARE STILL WIDELY USED IN VARIOUS DOWNSTREAM MODELS UNTIL NOW. THEREFORE, IT IS STILL OF CONSIDERABLE SIGNIFICANCE TO STUDY AND IMPROVE THEM, ESPECIALLY THE CRUCIAL COMPONENTS SHARED BY THESE STATIC MODELS. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE FOCUS ON NEGATIVE SAMPLING (NS), A KEY COMPONENT SHARED BY THE SAMPLING-BASED STATIC MODELS, BY INVESTIGATING AND MITIGATING SOME CRITICAL PROBLEMS OF THE SAMPLING CORE. CONCRETELY, WE PROPOSE SEEDS, A SAMPLING ENHANCED EMBEDDING FRAMEWORK, TO LEARN STATIC WORD EMBEDDINGS BY A NEW ALGORITHMIC INNOVATION FOR REPLACING THE NS ESTIMATOR, IN WHICH MULTIFACTOR GLOBAL PRIORS ARE CONSIDERED DYNAMICALLY FOR DIFFERENT TRAINING PAIRS. THEN, WE IMPLEMENT THIS FRAMEWORK BY FOUR CONCRETE MODELS. FOR THE FIRST TWO IMPLEMENTATIONS, NAMELY CBOW-GP AND SG-GP, BOTH NEGATIVE WORDS AND POSITIVE AUXILIARIES ARE SAMPLED. AND FOR THE OTHER TWO IMPLEMENTATIONS, CBOW-GN AND SG-GN, ESTIMATIONS ARE SIMPLIFIED BY SAMPLING ONLY THE NEGATIVE INSTANCES. EXTENSIVE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS ACROSS A VARIETY OF STANDARD INTRINSIC AND EXTRINSIC TASKS DEMONSTRATE THAT EMBEDDINGS LEARNED BY THE PROPOSED MODELS OUTPERFORM THEIR NS-BASED COUNTERPARTS, SUCH AS CBOW-NS AND SG-NS, AS WELL AS OTHER STRONG BASELINES.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
SEGMENT CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS (SEG-CNNS) FOR CLASSIFYING RELATIONS IN CLINICAL NOTES. WE PROPOSE SEGMENT CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS (SEG-CNNS) FOR CLASSIFYING RELATIONS FROM CLINICAL NOTES. SEG-CNNS USE ONLY WORD-EMBEDDING FEATURES WITHOUT MANUAL FEATURE ENGINEERING. UNLIKE TYPICAL CNN MODELS, RELATIONS BETWEEN 2 CONCEPTS ARE IDENTIFIED BY SIMULTANEOUSLY LEARNING SEPARATE REPRESENTATIONS FOR TEXT SEGMENTS IN A SENTENCE: PRECEDING, CONCEPT1, MIDDLE, CONCEPT2, AND SUCCEEDING. WE EVALUATE SEG-CNN ON THE I2B2/VA RELATION CLASSIFICATION CHALLENGE DATASET. WE SHOW THAT SEG-CNN ACHIEVES A STATE-OF-THE-ART MICRO-AVERAGE F-MEASURE OF 0.742 FOR OVERALL EVALUATION, 0.686 FOR CLASSIFYING MEDICAL PROBLEM-TREATMENT RELATIONS, 0.820 FOR MEDICAL PROBLEM-TEST RELATIONS, AND 0.702 FOR MEDICAL PROBLEM-MEDICAL PROBLEM RELATIONS. WE DEMONSTRATE THE BENEFITS OF LEARNING SEGMENT-LEVEL REPRESENTATIONS. WE SHOW THAT MEDICAL DOMAIN WORD EMBEDDINGS HELP IMPROVE RELATION CLASSIFICATION. SEG-CNNS CAN BE TRAINED QUICKLY FOR THE I2B2/VA DATASET ON A GRAPHICS PROCESSING UNIT (GPU) PLATFORM. THESE RESULTS SUPPORT THE USE OF CNNS COMPUTED OVER SEGMENTS OF TEXT FOR CLASSIFYING MEDICAL RELATIONS, AS THEY SHOW STATE-OF-THE-ART PERFORMANCE WHILE REQUIRING NO MANUAL FEATURE ENGINEERING.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
SEMANTIC CONCEPT SPACES: GUIDED TOPIC MODEL REFINEMENT USING WORD-EMBEDDING PROJECTIONS. WE PRESENT A FRAMEWORK THAT ALLOWS USERS TO INCORPORATE THE SEMANTICS OF THEIR DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE FOR TOPIC MODEL REFINEMENT WHILE REMAINING MODEL-AGNOSTIC. OUR APPROACH ENABLES USERS TO (1) UNDERSTAND THE SEMANTIC SPACE OF THE MODEL, (2) IDENTIFY REGIONS OF POTENTIAL CONFLICTS AND PROBLEMS, AND (3) READJUST THE SEMANTIC RELATION OF CONCEPTS BASED ON THEIR UNDERSTANDING, DIRECTLY INFLUENCING THE TOPIC MODELING. THESE TASKS ARE SUPPORTED BY AN INTERACTIVE VISUAL ANALYTICS WORKSPACE THAT USES WORD-EMBEDDING PROJECTIONS TO DEFINE CONCEPT REGIONS WHICH CAN THEN BE REFINED. THE USER-REFINED CONCEPTS ARE INDEPENDENT OF A PARTICULAR DOCUMENT COLLECTION AND CAN BE TRANSFERRED TO RELATED CORPORA. ALL USER INTERACTIONS WITHIN THE CONCEPT SPACE DIRECTLY AFFECT THE SEMANTIC RELATIONS OF THE UNDERLYING VECTOR SPACE MODEL, WHICH, IN TURN, CHANGE THE TOPIC MODELING. IN ADDITION TO DIRECT MANIPULATION, OUR SYSTEM GUIDES THE USERS' DECISION-MAKING PROCESS THROUGH RECOMMENDED INTERACTIONS THAT POINT OUT POTENTIAL IMPROVEMENTS. THIS TARGETED REFINEMENT AIMS AT MINIMIZING THE FEEDBACK REQUIRED FOR AN EFFICIENT HUMAN-IN-THE-LOOP PROCESS. WE CONFIRM THE IMPROVEMENTS ACHIEVED THROUGH OUR APPROACH IN TWO USER STUDIES THAT SHOW TOPIC MODEL QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS THROUGH OUR VISUAL KNOWLEDGE EXTERNALIZATION AND LEARNING PROCESS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
SEMANTIC LINKAGES OF OBSESSIONS FROM AN INTERNATIONAL OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER MOBILE APP DATA SET: BIG DATA ANALYTICS STUDY. BACKGROUND: OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER (OCD) IS CHARACTERIZED BY RECURRENT INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS, URGES, OR IMAGES (OBSESSIONS) AND REPETITIVE PHYSICAL OR MENTAL BEHAVIORS (COMPULSIONS). PREVIOUS FACTOR ANALYTIC AND CLUSTERING STUDIES SUGGEST THE PRESENCE OF THREE OR FOUR SUBTYPES OF OCD SYMPTOMS. HOWEVER, THESE STUDIES HAVE RELIED ON PREDEFINED SYMPTOM CHECKLISTS, WHICH ARE LIMITED IN BREADTH AND MAY BE BIASED TOWARD RESEARCHERS' PREVIOUS CONCEPTUALIZATIONS OF OCD. OBJECTIVE: IN THIS STUDY, WE EXAMINE A LARGE DATA SET OF FREELY REPORTED OBSESSION SYMPTOMS OBTAINED FROM AN OCD MOBILE APP AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO UNCOVERING POTENTIAL OCD SUBTYPES. FROM THIS, WE EXAMINE DATA-DRIVEN CLUSTERS OF OBSESSIONS BASED ON THEIR LATENT SEMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE USING WORD EMBEDDINGS. METHODS: WE EXTRACTED FREE-TEXT ENTRY WORDS DESCRIBING OBSESSIONS IN A LARGE SAMPLE OF USERS OF A MOBILE APP, NOCD. SEMANTIC VECTOR SPACE MODELING WAS APPLIED USING THE GLOBAL VECTORS FOR WORD REPRESENTATION ALGORITHM. A DOMAIN-SPECIFIC EXTENSION, MITTENS, WAS ALSO APPLIED TO ENHANCE THE CORPUS WITH OCD-SPECIFIC WORDS. THE RESULTING REPRESENTATIONS PROVIDED LINEAR SUBSTRUCTURES OF THE WORD VECTOR IN A 100-DIMENSIONAL SPACE. WE APPLIED PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS TO THE 100-DIMENSIONAL VECTOR REPRESENTATION OF THE MOST FREQUENT WORDS, FOLLOWED BY K-MEANS CLUSTERING TO OBTAIN CLUSTERS OF RELATED WORDS. RESULTS: WE OBTAINED 7001 UNIQUE WORDS REPRESENTING OBSESSIONS FROM 25,369 INDIVIDUALS. HEURISTICS FOR DETERMINING THE OPTIMAL NUMBER OF CLUSTERS POINTED TO A THREE-CLUSTER SOLUTION FOR GROUPING SUBTYPES OF OCD. THE FIRST HAD THEMES RELATING TO RELATIONSHIP AND JUST-RIGHT; THE SECOND HAD THEMES RELATING TO DOUBT AND CHECKING; AND THE THIRD HAD THEMES RELATING TO CONTAMINATION, SOMATIC, PHYSICAL HARM, AND SEXUAL HARM. ALL THREE CLUSTERS SHOWED CLOSE SEMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS WITH EACH OTHER IN THE CENTRAL AREA OF CONVERGENCE, WITH THEMES RELATING TO HARM. AN EQUAL-SIZED SPLIT-SAMPLE ANALYSIS ACROSS INDIVIDUALS AND A SPLIT-SAMPLE ANALYSIS OVER TIME BOTH SHOWED OVERALL STABLE CLUSTER SOLUTIONS. WORDS IN THE THIRD CLUSTER WERE THE MOST FREQUENTLY OCCURRING WORDS, FOLLOWED BY WORDS IN THE FIRST CLUSTER. CONCLUSIONS: THE CLUSTERING OF NATURALLY ACQUIRED OBSESSIONAL WORDS RESULTED IN THREE MAJOR GROUPINGS OF SEMANTIC THEMES, WHICH PARTIALLY OVERLAPPED WITH PREDEFINED CHECKLISTS FROM PREVIOUS STUDIES. FURTHERMORE, THE CLOSENESS OF THE OVERALL EMBEDDED RELATIONSHIPS ACROSS CLUSTERS AND THEIR CENTRAL CONVERGENCE ON HARM SUGGESTS THAT, AT LEAST AT THE LEVEL OF SELF-REPORTED OBSESSIONAL THOUGHTS, MOST OBSESSIONS HAVE CLOSE SEMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS. HARM TO SELF OR OTHERS MAY BE AN UNDERLYING ORGANIZING THEME ACROSS MANY OBSESSIONS. NOTABLY, RELATIONSHIP-THEMED WORDS, NOT PREVIOUSLY INCLUDED IN FACTOR-ANALYTIC STUDIES, CLUSTERED WITH JUST-RIGHT WORDS. THESE NOVEL INSIGHTS HAVE POTENTIAL IMPLICATIONS FOR UNDERSTANDING HOW AN APPARENT MULTITUDE OF OBSESSIONAL SYMPTOMS ARE CONNECTED BY UNDERLYING THEMES. THIS OBSERVATION COULD AID EXPOSURE-BASED TREATMENT APPROACHES AND COULD BE USED AS A CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK FOR FUTURE RESEARCH.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
SENTIVEC: LEARNING SENTIMENT-CONTEXT VECTOR VIA KERNEL OPTIMIZATION FUNCTION FOR SENTIMENT ANALYSIS. DEEP LEARNING-BASED SENTIMENT ANALYSIS (SA) METHODS HAVE DRAWN MORE ATTENTION IN RECENT YEARS, WHICH CALLS FOR MORE PRECISE WORD EMBEDDING METHODS. THIS ARTICLE PROPOSES SENTIVEC, A KERNEL OPTIMIZATION FUNCTION SYSTEM FOR SENTIMENT WORD EMBEDDING, WHICH IS BASED ON TWO PHASES. THE FIRST PHASE IS A SUPERVISED LEARNING METHOD, AND THE SECOND PHASE CONSISTS OF TWO UNSUPERVISED UPDATING MODELS, OBJECT-WORD-TO-SURROUNDING-WORDS REWARD MODEL (O2SR) AND CONTEXT-TO-OBJECT-WORD REWARD MODEL (C2OR). SENTIVEC IS AIMED AT: 1) INTEGRATING THE STATISTICAL INFORMATION AND SENTIMENT ORIENTATION INTO SENTIMENT WORD VECTORS AND 2) PROPAGATING AND UPDATING THE SEMANTIC INFORMATION TO ALL THE WORD REPRESENTATIONS IN A CORPUS. EXTENSIVE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS SHOW THAT THE OPTIMAL SENTIMENT VECTORS SUCCESSFULLY EXTRACT THE FEATURES IN TERMS OF SEMANTIC AND SENTIMENT INFORMATION, WHICH MAKES IT OUTPERFORM THE BASELINE METHODS ON WORD SIMILARITY, WORD ANALOGY, AND SA TASKS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
SEQUENCE-BASED DEEP LEARNING FRAMEWORKS ON ENHANCER-PROMOTER INTERACTIONS PREDICTION. ENHANCER-PROMOTER INTERACTIONS (EPIS) IN THE HUMAN GENOME ARE OF GREAT SIGNIFICANCE TO TRANSCRIPTIONAL REGULATION, WHICH TIGHTLY CONTROLS GENE EXPRESSION. IDENTIFICATION OF EPIS CAN HELP US BETTER DECIPHER GENE REGULATION AND UNDERSTAND DISEASE MECHANISMS. HOWEVER, EXPERIMENTAL METHODS TO IDENTIFY EPIS ARE CONSTRAINED BY FUNDS, TIME, AND MANPOWER, WHILE COMPUTATIONAL METHODS USING DNA SEQUENCES AND GENOMIC FEATURES ARE VIABLE ALTERNATIVES. DEEP LEARNING METHODS HAVE SHOWN PROMISING PROSPECTS IN CLASSIFICATION AND EFFORTS THAT HAVE BEEN UTILIZED TO IDENTIFY EPIS. IN THIS SURVEY, WE SPECIFICALLY FOCUS ON SEQUENCE-BASED DEEP LEARNING METHODS AND CONDUCT A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE. FIRST, WE BRIEFLY INTRODUCE EXISTING SEQUENCE- BASED FRAMEWORKS ON EPIS PREDICTION AND THEIR TECHNIQUE DETAILS. AFTER THAT, WE ELABORATE ON THE DATASET, PRE-PROCESSING MEANS, AND EVALUATION STRATEGIES. FINALLY, WE CONCLUDED WITH THE CHALLENGES THESE METHODS ARE CONFRONTED WITH AND SUGGEST SEVERAL FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES. WE HOPE THIS REVIEW WILL PROVIDE A USEFUL REFERENCE FOR FURTHER STUDIES ON ENHANCER-PROMOTER INTERACTIONS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
SEQUENTIAL PROPERTIES REPRESENTATION SCHEME FOR RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORK-BASED PREDICTION OF THERAPEUTIC PEPTIDES. THE DISCOVERY OF THERAPEUTIC PEPTIDES IS OFTEN ACCELERATED BY MEANS OF VIRTUAL SCREENING SUPPORTED BY MACHINE LEARNING-BASED PREDICTIVE MODELS. THE PREDICTIVE PERFORMANCE OF SUCH MODELS IS SENSITIVE TO THE CHOICE OF DATA AND ITS REPRESENTATION SCHEME. WHILE THE PEPTIDE PHYSICOCHEMICAL AND COMPOSITIONAL REPRESENTATIONS FAIL TO DISTINGUISH SEQUENCE PERMUTATIONS, THE AMINO ACID ARRANGEMENT WITHIN THE SEQUENCE LACKS THE IMPORTANT INFORMATION CONTAINED IN PHYSICOCHEMICAL, CONFORMATIONAL, TOPOLOGICAL, AND GEOMETRICAL PROPERTIES. IN THIS PAPER, WE PROPOSE A SOLUTION TO THE IDENTIFIED INFORMATION GAP BY IMPLEMENTING A HYBRID SCHEME THAT COMPLEMENTS THE BEST TRAITS FROM BOTH APPROACHES WITH THE AIM OF PREDICTING ANTIMICROBIAL AND ANTIVIRAL ACTIVITIES BASED ON EXPERIMENTAL DATA FROM DRAMP 2.0, AVPDB, AND UNIPROT DATA REPOSITORIES. USING THE FRIEDMAN TEST OF STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE, WE COMPARED OUR HYBRID, SEQUENTIAL PROPERTIES APPROACH TO PEPTIDE PROPERTIES, ONE-HOT VECTOR ENCODING, AND WORD EMBEDDING SCHEMES IN THE 10-FOLD CROSS-VALIDATION SETTING, WITH RESPECT TO THE F1 SCORE, MATTHEWS CORRELATION COEFFICIENT, GEOMETRIC MEAN, RECALL, AND PRECISION EVALUATION METRICS. MOREOVER, THE SEQUENCE MODELING NEURAL NETWORK WAS EMPLOYED TO GAIN INSIGHT INTO THE SYNERGIC EFFECT OF BOTH PROPERTIES- AND AMINO ACID ORDER-BASED PREDICTIONS. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT SEQUENTIAL PROPERTIES SIGNIFICANTLY (P < 0.01) SURPASSES THE AFOREMENTIONED STATE-OF-THE-ART REPRESENTATION SCHEMES. THIS MAKES IT A STRONG CANDIDATE FOR INCREASING THE PREDICTIVE POWER OF SCREENING METHODS BASED ON MACHINE LEARNING, APPLICABLE TO ANY CATEGORY OF PEPTIDES.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
SERENDIPITY-A MACHINE-LEARNING APPLICATION FOR MINING SERENDIPITOUS DRUG USAGE FROM SOCIAL MEDIA. SERENDIPITOUS DRUG USAGE REFERS TO THE UNEXPECTED RELIEF OF COMORBID DISEASES OR SYMPTOMS WHEN TAKING MEDICATION FOR A DIFFERENT KNOWN INDICATION. HISTORICALLY, SERENDIPITY HAS CONTRIBUTED SIGNIFICANTLY TO IDENTIFYING MANY NEW DRUG INDICATIONS. IF PATIENT-REPORTED SERENDIPITOUS DRUG USAGE IN SOCIAL MEDIA COULD BE COMPUTATIONALLY IDENTIFIED, IT COULD HELP GENERATE AND VALIDATE DRUG-REPOSITIONING HYPOTHESES. WE INVESTIGATED DEEP NEURAL NETWORK MODELS FOR MINING SERENDIPITOUS DRUG USAGE FROM SOCIAL MEDIA. WE USED THE WORD2VEC ALGORITHM TO CONSTRUCT WORD-EMBEDDING FEATURES FROM DRUG REVIEWS POSTED IN A WEBMD PATIENT FORUM. WE ADAPTED AND REDESIGNED THE CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK, LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY NETWORK, AND CONVOLUTIONAL LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY NETWORK BY ADDING CONTEXTUAL INFORMATION EXTRACTED FROM DRUG-REVIEW POSTS, INFORMATION-FILTERING TOOLS, MEDICAL ONTOLOGY, AND MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE. WE TRAINED, TUNED, AND EVALUATED OUR MODELS WITH A GOLD-STANDARD DATASET OF 15714 SENTENCES (447 [2.8%] DESCRIBING SERENDIPITOUS DRUG USAGE). ADDITIONALLY, WE COMPARED OUR DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS TO SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE, RANDOM FOREST, AND ADABOOST.M1 ALGORITHMS. CONTEXT INFORMATION HELPED TO REDUCE THE FALSE-POSITIVE RATE OF DEEP NEURAL NETWORK MODELS. IF WE USED AN EXTREMELY IMBALANCED DATASET WITH LIMITED INSTANCES OF SERENDIPITOUS DRUG USAGE, DEEP NEURAL NETWORK MODELS DID NOT OUTPERFORM OTHER MACHINE-LEARNING MODELS WITH N-GRAM AND CONTEXT FEATURES. HOWEVER, DEEP NEURAL NETWORK MODELS COULD MORE EFFECTIVELY USE WORD EMBEDDING IN FEATURE CONSTRUCTION, AN ADVANTAGE THAT MAKES THEM WORTHY OF FURTHER INVESTIGATION. FINALLY, WE IMPLEMENTED NATURAL-LANGUAGE PROCESSING AND MACHINE-LEARNING METHODS IN A WEB-BASED APPLICATION TO HELP SCIENTISTS AND SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS MINE SOCIAL MEDIA FOR SERENDIPITOUS DRUG USAGE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
SIBERT: A SIAMESE-BASED BERT NETWORK FOR CHINESE MEDICAL ENTITIES ALIGNMENT. ENTITY ALIGNMENT AIMS AT ASSOCIATING SEMANTICALLY SIMILAR ENTITIES IN KNOWLEDGE GRAPHS FROM DIFFERENT SOURCES. IT IS WIDELY USED IN THE INTEGRATION AND CONSTRUCTION OF PROFESSIONAL MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE. THE EXISTING DEEP LEARNING METHODS LACK TERM-LEVEL EMBEDDING REPRESENTATION, WHICH LIMITS THE PERFORMANCE OF ENTITY ALIGNMENT AND CAUSES A MASSIVE COMPUTATIONAL OVERHEAD. TO ADDRESS THESE PROBLEMS, WE PROPOSE A SIAMESE-BASED BERT (SIBERT) FOR CHINESE MEDICAL ENTITIES ALIGNMENT. SIBERT GENERATES TERM-LEVEL EMBEDDING BASED ON WORD EMBEDDING SEQUENCES TO ENHANCE THE FEATURES OF ENTITIES IN SIMILARITY CALCULATION. THE PROCESS OF ENTITY ALIGNMENT CONTAINS THREE STEPS. SPECIFICALLY, THE SIBERT IS FIRSTLY PRE-TRAINED WITH SYNONYM DICTIONARY IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN, AND TRANSFERRED TO THE TASK OF MEDICAL ENTITY ALIGNMENT. SECONDLY, FOUR DIFFERENT CATEGORIES OF ENTITIES (DISEASE, SYMPTOM, TREATMENT, AND EXAMINATION) ARE LABELED BASED ON THE STANDARD TERMS SELECTED FROM STANDARD TERMS DATASET. THE ENTITIES AND THEIR STANDARD TERMS FORM TERM PAIRS TO TRAIN SIBERT. FINALLY, COMBINED WITH THE ENTITY ALIGNMENT ALGORITHM, THE MOST SIMILAR STANDARD TERM IS SELECTED AS THE FINAL RESULT. TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR METHOD, WE CONDUCT EXTENSIVE EXPERIMENTS ON REAL-WORLD DATASETS. THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS ILLUSTRATE THAT SIBERT NETWORK IS SUPERIOR TO OTHER COMPARED ALGORITHMS BOTH IN ALIGNMENT ACCURACY AND COMPUTATIONAL EFFICIENCY.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
SIMILARITY-BASED UNSUPERVISED SPELLING CORRECTION USING BIOWORDVEC: DEVELOPMENT AND USABILITY STUDY OF BACTERIAL CULTURE AND ANTIMICROBIAL SUSCEPTIBILITY REPORTS. BACKGROUND: EXISTING BACTERIAL CULTURE TEST RESULTS FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASES ARE WRITTEN IN UNREFINED TEXT, RESULTING IN MANY PROBLEMS, INCLUDING TYPOGRAPHICAL ERRORS AND STOP WORDS. EFFECTIVE SPELLING CORRECTION PROCESSES ARE NEEDED TO ENSURE THE ACCURACY AND RELIABILITY OF DATA FOR THE STUDY OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES, INCLUDING MEDICAL TERMINOLOGY EXTRACTION. IF A DICTIONARY IS ESTABLISHED, SPELLING ALGORITHMS USING EDIT DISTANCE ARE EFFICIENT. HOWEVER, IN THE ABSENCE OF A DICTIONARY, TRADITIONAL SPELLING CORRECTION ALGORITHMS THAT UTILIZE ONLY EDIT DISTANCES HAVE LIMITATIONS. OBJECTIVE: IN THIS RESEARCH, WE PROPOSED A SIMILARITY-BASED SPELLING CORRECTION ALGORITHM USING PRETRAINED WORD EMBEDDING WITH THE BIOWORDVEC TECHNIQUE. THIS METHOD USES A CHARACTER-LEVEL N-GRAMS-BASED DISTRIBUTED REPRESENTATION THROUGH UNSUPERVISED LEARNING RATHER THAN THE EXISTING RULE-BASED METHOD. IN OTHER WORDS, WE PROPOSE A FRAMEWORK THAT DETECTS AND CORRECTS TYPOGRAPHICAL ERRORS WHEN A DICTIONARY IS NOT IN PLACE. METHODS: FOR DETECTED TYPOGRAPHICAL ERRORS NOT MAPPED TO SYSTEMATIZED NOMENCLATURE OF MEDICINE (SNOMED) CLINICAL TERMS, A CORRECTION CANDIDATE GROUP WITH HIGH SIMILARITY CONSIDERING THE EDIT DISTANCE WAS GENERATED USING PRETRAINED WORD EMBEDDING FROM THE CLINICAL DATABASE. FROM THE EMBEDDING MATRIX IN WHICH THE VOCABULARY IS ARRANGED IN DESCENDING ORDER ACCORDING TO FREQUENCY, A GRID SEARCH WAS USED TO SEARCH FOR CANDIDATE GROUPS OF SIMILAR WORDS. THEREAFTER, THE CORRECTION CANDIDATE WORDS WERE RANKED IN CONSIDERATION OF THE FREQUENCY OF THE WORDS, AND THE TYPOGRAPHICAL ERRORS WERE FINALLY CORRECTED ACCORDING TO THE RANKING. RESULTS: BACTERIAL IDENTIFICATION WORDS WERE EXTRACTED FROM 27,544 BACTERIAL CULTURE AND ANTIMICROBIAL SUSCEPTIBILITY REPORTS, AND 16 TYPES OF SPELLING ERRORS AND 914 MISSPELLED WORDS WERE FOUND. THE SIMILARITY-BASED SPELLING CORRECTION ALGORITHM USING BIOWORDVEC PROPOSED IN THIS RESEARCH CORRECTED 12 TYPES OF TYPOGRAPHICAL ERRORS AND SHOWED VERY HIGH PERFORMANCE IN CORRECTING 97.48% (BASED ON F1 SCORE) OF ALL SPELLING ERRORS. CONCLUSIONS: THIS TOOL CORRECTED SPELLING ERRORS EFFECTIVELY IN THE ABSENCE OF A DICTIONARY BASED ON BACTERIAL IDENTIFICATION WORDS IN BACTERIAL CULTURE AND ANTIMICROBIAL SUSCEPTIBILITY REPORTS. THIS METHOD WILL HELP BUILD A HIGH-QUALITY REFINED DATABASE OF VAST TEXT DATA FOR ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
SIMPLIFYING DRUG PACKAGE LEAFLETS WRITTEN IN SPANISH BY USING WORD EMBEDDING. BACKGROUND: DRUG PACKAGE LEAFLETS (DPLS) PROVIDE INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS ON HOW TO SAFELY USE MEDICINES. PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PRODUCING THESE DOCUMENTS. HOWEVER, SEVERAL STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT PATIENTS USUALLY HAVE PROBLEMS IN UNDERSTANDING SECTIONS DESCRIBING POSOLOGY (DOSAGE QUANTITY AND PRESCRIPTION), CONTRAINDICATIONS AND ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS. AN ULTIMATE GOAL OF THIS WORK IS TO PROVIDE AN AUTOMATIC APPROACH THAT HELPS THESE COMPANIES TO WRITE DRUG PACKAGE LEAFLETS IN AN EASY-TO-UNDERSTAND LANGUAGE. NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING HAS BECOME A POWERFUL TOOL FOR IMPROVING PATIENT CARE AND ADVANCING MEDICINE BECAUSE IT LEADS TO AUTOMATICALLY PROCESS THE LARGE AMOUNT OF UNSTRUCTURED INFORMATION NEEDED FOR PATIENT CARE. HOWEVER, TO THE BEST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE, NO RESEARCH HAS BEEN DONE ON THE AUTOMATIC SIMPLIFICATION OF DRUG PACKAGE LEAFLETS. IN A PREVIOUS WORK, WE PROPOSED TO USE DOMAIN TERMINOLOGICAL RESOURCES FOR GATHERING A SET OF SYNONYMS FOR A GIVEN TARGET TERM. A POTENTIAL DRAWBACK OF THIS APPROACH IS THAT IT DEPENDS HEAVILY ON THE EXISTENCE OF DICTIONARIES, HOWEVER THESE ARE NOT ALWAYS AVAILABLE FOR ANY DOMAIN AND LANGUAGE OR IF THEY EXIST, THEIR COVERAGE IS VERY SCARCE. TO OVERCOME THIS LIMITATION, WE PROPOSE THE USE OF WORD EMBEDDINGS TO IDENTIFY THE SIMPLEST SYNONYM FOR A GIVEN TERM. WORD EMBEDDING MODELS REPRESENT EACH WORD IN A CORPUS WITH A VECTOR IN A SEMANTIC SPACE. OUR APPROACH IS BASED ON ASSUMPTION THAT SYNONYMS SHOULD HAVE CLOSE VECTORS BECAUSE THEY OCCUR IN SIMILAR CONTEXTS. RESULTS: IN OUR EVALUATION, WE USED THE CORPUS EASYDPL (EASY DRUG PACKAGE LEAFLETS), A COLLECTION OF 306 LEAFLETS WRITTEN IN SPANISH AND MANUALLY ANNOTATED WITH 1400 ADVERSE DRUG EFFECTS AND THEIR SIMPLEST SYNONYMS. WE FOCUS ON LEAFLETS WRITTEN IN SPANISH BECAUSE IT IS THE SECOND MOST WIDELY SPOKEN LANGUAGE ON THE WORLD, BUT AS FOR THE EXISTENCE OF TERMINOLOGICAL RESOURCES, THE SPANISH LANGUAGE IS USUALLY LESS PROLIFIC THAN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. OUR EXPERIMENTS SHOW AN ACCURACY OF 38.5% USING WORD EMBEDDINGS. CONCLUSIONS: THIS WORK PROVIDES A PROMISING APPROACH TO SIMPLIFY DPLS WITHOUT USING TERMINOLOGICAL RESOURCES OR PARALLEL CORPORA. MOREOVER, IT COULD BE EASILY ADAPTED TO DIFFERENT DOMAINS AND LANGUAGES. HOWEVER, MORE RESEARCH EFFORTS ARE NEEDED TO IMPROVE OUR APPROACH BASED ON WORD EMBEDDING BECAUSE IT DOES NOT OVERCOME OUR PREVIOUS WORK USING DICTIONARIES YET.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
SMAD: SMART ASSISTANT DURING AND AFTER A MEDICAL EMERGENCY CASE BASED ON DEEP LEARNING SENTIMENT ANALYSIS: THE PANDEMIC COVID-19 CASE. THE HUGE COST OF EMERGENCY SITUATIONS COULD HAVE FATAL EFFECTS ON HUMANITY AND SOCIETY, AND IT COULD PRESENT A GENUINE THREAT TO BOTH OF THEM. IN FACT, MOST PEOPLE CONFRONTED WITH AN EMERGENCY COULD FEEL PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAUMA, WHICH WILL, FOR THE MOST PART, CHANGE OVER TIME AS THEY CAN EXHIBIT CHAOTIC OR EVEN TURBULENT BEHAVIOURS. THE SITUATION COULD WORSEN IN THE CASE OF A PANDEMIC AS FEAR AND ANXIETY INVADE AND SPREAD IN ADDITION TO ISOLATION AND QUARANTINE. IN THIS PAPER, WE PROPOSE TO BUILD A SMART ASSISTANT, CALLED SMAD, THAT COULD DETECT THE SYMPTOMS OF AN EMERGENCY CASE AS WELL AS SYMPTOMS OF A MENTAL DISORDER WHILE ANALYSING THE NATURAL LANGUAGE SPEECH OF AN ORDINARY CITIZEN, DURING AND AFTER AN EMERGENCY SITUATION USING NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING AND DEEP LEARNING SENTIMENT ANALYSIS MODEL TO TRACK THE PATIENT'S MENTAL STATE DURING AN ONGOING CONVERSATION. OUR PROPOSED SMART ASSISTANT IS AN ONLINE HUMAN-BOT INTERACTION THAT COULD HANDLE A VARIETY OF PHYSICAL AND MENTAL CIRCUMSTANCES OF ANY EMERGENCY SITUATION. THE PROPOSED APPROACH IS A SMART HEALTHCARE SERVICE THAT CONSISTS OF FOUR INTERCONNECTED MODULES: THE INFORMATION UNDERSTANDING MODULE, THE DATA COLLECTOR MODULE, THE ACTION GENERATOR MODULE, AND THE MENTAL ANALYSIS MODULE, WHICH IS BASED ON THE SENTIMENT ANALYSIS MODEL PERFORMED ON A SOCIAL MEDIA DATASET USING A PRE-TRAINED WORD-EMBEDDING MODEL.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
SOCIAL MINING FOR SUSTAINABLE CITIES: THEMATIC STUDY OF GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE COVERAGE IN NEWS ARTICLES AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN RELATION TO COVID-19. WE ARGUE THAT SOCIAL COMPUTING AND ITS DIVERSE APPLICATIONS CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THE ATTAINMENT OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS (SDGS)-SPECIFICALLY TO THE SDGS CONCERNING GENDER EQUALITY AND EMPOWERMENT OF ALL WOMEN AND GIRLS, AND TO MAKE CITIES AND HUMAN SETTLEMENTS INCLUSIVE. TO ACHIEVE THE ABOVE GOALS FOR THE SUSTAINABLE GROWTH OF SOCIETIES, IT IS CRUCIAL TO STUDY GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE (GBV) IN A SMART CITY CONTEXT, WHICH IS A COMMON COMPONENT OF VIOLENCE ACROSS SOCIO-ECONOMIC GROUPS GLOBALLY. THIS PAPER ANALYZES THE NATURE OF NEWS ARTICLES REPORTED IN ENGLISH NEWSPAPERS OF PAKISTAN, INDIA, AND THE UK-ACCUMULATING 12,693 GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE-RELATED NEWS ARTICLES. FOR THE QUALITATIVE TEXTUAL ANALYSIS, WE EMPLOY LATENT DIRICHLET ALLOCATION FOR TOPIC MODELING AND PROPOSE A DOC2VEC BASED WORD-EMBEDDINGS MODEL TO CLASSIFY GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE-RELATED CONTENT, CALLED GBV2VEC. FURTHER, BY LEVERAGING GBV2VEC, WE ALSO BUILD AN ONLINE TOOL THAT ANALYZES THE SENSITIVITY OF GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE-RELATED CONTENT FROM THE TEXTUAL DATA. WE RUN A CASE STUDY ON GBV CONCERNING COVID-19 BY FEEDING THE DATA COLLECTED THROUGH GOOGLE NEWS API. FINALLY, WE SHOW DIFFERENT NEWS REPORTING TRENDS AND THE NATURE OF THE GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE COMMITTED DURING THE TESTING TIMES OF COVID-19. THE APPROACH AND THE TOOLKIT THAT THIS PAPER PROPOSES WILL BE OF GREAT VALUE TO DECISION-MAKERS AND HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS, GIVEN THE PROMPT AND COORDINATED PERFORMANCE AGAINST GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE IN SMART CITY CONTEXT-AND CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THE ACHIEVEMENT OF SDGS FOR SUSTAINABLE GROWTH OF HUMAN SOCIETIES.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
SOFTWARE DEFECT PREDICTION USING HYBRID MODEL (CBIL) OF CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (CNN) AND BIDIRECTIONAL LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY (BI-LSTM). IN RECENT YEARS, THE SOFTWARE INDUSTRY HAS INVESTED SUBSTANTIAL EFFORT TO IMPROVE SOFTWARE QUALITY IN ORGANIZATIONS. APPLYING PROACTIVE SOFTWARE DEFECT PREDICTION WILL HELP DEVELOPERS AND WHITE BOX TESTERS TO FIND THE DEFECTS EARLIER, AND THIS WILL REDUCE THE TIME AND EFFORT. TRADITIONAL SOFTWARE DEFECT PREDICTION MODELS CONCENTRATE ON TRADITIONAL FEATURES OF SOURCE CODE INCLUDING CODE COMPLEXITY, LINES OF CODE, ETC. HOWEVER, THESE FEATURES FAIL TO EXTRACT THE SEMANTICS OF SOURCE CODE. IN THIS RESEARCH, WE PROPOSE A HYBRID MODEL THAT IS CALLED CBIL. CBIL CAN PREDICT THE DEFECTIVE AREAS OF SOURCE CODE. IT EXTRACTS ABSTRACT SYNTAX TREE (AST) TOKENS AS VECTORS FROM SOURCE CODE. MAPPING AND WORD EMBEDDING TURN INTEGER VECTORS INTO DENSE VECTORS. THEN, CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (CNN) EXTRACTS THE SEMANTICS OF AST TOKENS. AFTER THAT, BIDIRECTIONAL LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY (BI-LSTM) KEEPS KEY FEATURES AND IGNORES OTHER FEATURES IN ORDER TO ENHANCE THE ACCURACY OF SOFTWARE DEFECT PREDICTION. THE PROPOSED MODEL CBIL IS EVALUATED ON A SAMPLE OF SEVEN OPEN-SOURCE JAVA PROJECTS OF THE PROMISE DATASET. CBIL IS EVALUATED BY APPLYING THE FOLLOWING EVALUATION METRICS: F-MEASURE AND AREA UNDER THE CURVE (AUC). THE RESULTS DISPLAY THAT CBIL MODEL IMPROVES THE AVERAGE OF F-MEASURE BY 25% COMPARED TO CNN, AS CNN ACCOMPLISHES THE TOP PERFORMANCE AMONG THE SELECTED BASELINE MODELS. IN AVERAGE OF AUC, CBIL MODEL IMPROVES AUC BY 18% COMPARED TO RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORK (RNN), AS RNN ACCOMPLISHES THE TOP PERFORMANCE AMONG THE SELECTED BASELINE MODELS USED IN THE EXPERIMENTS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
SPECULATION DETECTION FOR CHINESE CLINICAL NOTES: IMPACTS OF WORD SEGMENTATION AND EMBEDDING MODELS. SPECULATIONS REPRESENT UNCERTAINTY TOWARD CERTAIN FACTS. IN CLINICAL TEXTS, IDENTIFYING SPECULATIONS IS A CRITICAL STEP OF NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP). WHILE IT IS A NONTRIVIAL TASK IN MANY LANGUAGES, DETECTING SPECULATIONS IN CHINESE CLINICAL NOTES CAN BE PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING BECAUSE WORD SEGMENTATION MAY BE NECESSARY AS AN UPSTREAM OPERATION. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PAPER IS TO CONSTRUCT A STATE-OF-THE-ART SPECULATION DETECTION SYSTEM FOR CHINESE CLINICAL NOTES AND TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER EMBEDDING FEATURES AND WORD SEGMENTATIONS ARE WORTH EXPLOITING TOWARD THIS OVERALL TASK. WE PROPOSE A SEQUENCE LABELING BASED SYSTEM FOR SPECULATION DETECTION, WHICH RELIES ON FEATURES FROM BAG OF CHARACTERS, BAG OF WORDS, CHARACTER EMBEDDING, AND WORD EMBEDDING. WE EXPERIMENT ON A NOVEL DATASET OF 36,828 CLINICAL NOTES WITH 5103 GOLD-STANDARD SPECULATION ANNOTATIONS ON 2000 NOTES, AND COMPARE THE SYSTEMS IN WHICH WORD EMBEDDINGS ARE CALCULATED BASED ON WORD SEGMENTATIONS GIVEN BY GENERAL AND BY DOMAIN SPECIFIC SEGMENTERS RESPECTIVELY. OUR SYSTEMS ARE ABLE TO REACH PERFORMANCE AS HIGH AS 92.2% MEASURED BY F SCORE. WE DEMONSTRATE THAT WORD SEGMENTATION IS CRITICAL TO PRODUCE HIGH QUALITY WORD EMBEDDING TO FACILITATE DOWNSTREAM INFORMATION EXTRACTION APPLICATIONS, AND SUGGEST THAT A DOMAIN DEPENDENT WORD SEGMENTER CAN BE VITAL TO SUCH A CLINICAL NLP TASK IN CHINESE LANGUAGE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
SUMMARIZATION OF BIOMEDICAL ARTICLES USING DOMAIN-SPECIFIC WORD EMBEDDINGS AND GRAPH RANKING. TEXT SUMMARIZATION TOOLS CAN HELP BIOMEDICAL RESEARCHERS AND CLINICIANS REDUCE THE TIME AND EFFORT NEEDED FOR ACQUIRING IMPORTANT INFORMATION FROM NUMEROUS DOCUMENTS. IT HAS BEEN SHOWN THAT THE INPUT TEXT CAN BE MODELED AS A GRAPH, AND IMPORTANT SENTENCES CAN BE SELECTED BY IDENTIFYING CENTRAL NODES WITHIN THE GRAPH. HOWEVER, THE EFFECTIVE REPRESENTATION OF DOCUMENTS, QUANTIFYING THE RELATEDNESS OF SENTENCES, AND SELECTING THE MOST INFORMATIVE SENTENCES ARE MAIN CHALLENGES THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED IN GRAPH-BASED SUMMARIZATION. IN THIS PAPER, WE ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES IN THE CONTEXT OF BIOMEDICAL TEXT SUMMARIZATION. WE EVALUATE THE EFFICACY OF A GRAPH-BASED SUMMARIZER USING DIFFERENT TYPES OF CONTEXT-FREE AND CONTEXTUALIZED EMBEDDINGS. THE WORD REPRESENTATIONS ARE PRODUCED BY PRE-TRAINING NEURAL LANGUAGE MODELS ON LARGE CORPORA OF BIOMEDICAL TEXTS. THE SUMMARIZER MODELS THE INPUT TEXT AS A GRAPH IN WHICH THE STRENGTH OF RELATIONS BETWEEN SENTENCES IS MEASURED USING THE DOMAIN SPECIFIC VECTOR REPRESENTATIONS. WE ALSO ASSESS THE USEFULNESS OF DIFFERENT GRAPH RANKING TECHNIQUES IN THE SENTENCE SELECTION STEP OF OUR SUMMARIZATION METHOD. USING THE COMMON RECALL-ORIENTED UNDERSTUDY FOR GISTING EVALUATION (ROUGE) METRICS, WE EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR SUMMARIZER AGAINST VARIOUS COMPARISON METHODS. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT WHEN THE SUMMARIZER UTILIZES PROPER COMBINATIONS OF CONTEXT-FREE AND CONTEXTUALIZED EMBEDDINGS, ALONG WITH AN EFFECTIVE RANKING METHOD, IT CAN OUTPERFORM THE OTHER METHODS. WE DEMONSTRATE THAT THE BEST SETTINGS OF OUR GRAPH-BASED SUMMARIZER CAN EFFICIENTLY IMPROVE THE INFORMATIVE CONTENT OF SUMMARIES AND DECREASE THE REDUNDANCY.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
SUPERVISED LEARNING AND KNOWLEDGE-BASED APPROACHES APPLIED TO BIOMEDICAL WORD SENSE DISAMBIGUATION. WORD SENSE DISAMBIGUATION (WSD) IS AN IMPORTANT STEP IN BIOMEDICAL TEXT MINING, WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ASSIGNING AN UNEQUIVOCAL CONCEPT TO AN AMBIGUOUS TERM, IMPROVING THE ACCURACY OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATION EXTRACTION SYSTEMS. IN THIS WORK WE FOLLOWED SUPERVISED AND KNOWLEDGE-BASED DISAMBIGUATION APPROACHES, WITH THE BEST RESULTS OBTAINED BY SUPERVISED MEANS. IN THE SUPERVISED METHOD WE USED BAG-OF-WORDS AS LOCAL FEATURES, AND WORD EMBEDDINGS AS GLOBAL FEATURES. IN THE KNOWLEDGE-BASED METHOD WE COMBINED WORD EMBEDDINGS, CONCEPT TEXTUAL DEFINITIONS EXTRACTED FROM THE UMLS DATABASE, AND CONCEPT ASSOCIATION VALUES CALCULATED FROM THE MESH CO-OCCURRENCE COUNTS FROM MEDLINE ARTICLES. ALSO, IN THE KNOWLEDGE-BASED METHOD, WE TESTED DIFFERENT WORD EMBEDDING AVERAGING FUNCTIONS TO CALCULATE THE SURROUNDING CONTEXT VECTORS, WITH THE GOAL TO GIVE MORE IMPORTANCE TO CLOSEST WORDS OF THE AMBIGUOUS TERM. THE MSH WSD DATASET, THE MOST COMMON DATASET USED FOR EVALUATING BIOMEDICAL CONCEPT DISAMBIGUATION, WAS USED TO EVALUATE OUR METHODS. WE OBTAINED A TOP ACCURACY OF 95.6 % BY SUPERVISED MEANS, WHILE THE BEST KNOWLEDGE-BASED ACCURACY WAS 87.4 %. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT WORD EMBEDDING MODELS IMPROVED THE DISAMBIGUATION ACCURACY, PROVING TO BE A POWERFUL RESOURCE IN THE WSD TASK.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
SYNTACTICALLY-INFORMED WORD REPRESENTATIONS FROM GRAPH NEURAL NETWORK. MOST DEEP LANGUAGE UNDERSTANDING MODELS DEPEND ONLY ON WORD REPRESENTATIONS, WHICH ARE MAINLY BASED ON LANGUAGE MODELLING DERIVED FROM A LARGE AMOUNT OF RAW TEXT. THESE MODELS ENCODE DISTRIBUTIONAL KNOWLEDGE WITHOUT CONSIDERING SYNTACTIC STRUCTURAL INFORMATION, ALTHOUGH SEVERAL STUDIES HAVE SHOWN BENEFITS OF INCLUDING SUCH INFORMATION. THEREFORE, WE PROPOSE NEW SYNTACTICALLY-INFORMED WORD REPRESENTATIONS (SIWRS), WHICH ALLOW US TO ENRICH THE PRE-TRAINED WORD REPRESENTATIONS WITH SYNTACTIC INFORMATION WITHOUT TRAINING LANGUAGE MODELS FROM SCRATCH. TO OBTAIN SIWRS, A GRAPH-BASED NEURAL MODEL IS BUILT ON TOP OF EITHER STATIC OR CONTEXTUALISED WORD REPRESENTATIONS SUCH AS GLOVE, ELMO AND BERT. THE MODEL IS FIRST PRE-TRAINED WITH ONLY A RELATIVELY MODEST AMOUNT OF TASK-INDEPENDENT DATA THAT ARE AUTOMATICALLY ANNOTATED USING EXISTING SYNTACTIC TOOLS. SIWRS ARE THEN OBTAINED BY APPLYING THE MODEL TO DOWNSTREAM TASK DATA AND EXTRACTING THE INTERMEDIATE WORD REPRESENTATIONS. WE FINALLY REPLACE WORD REPRESENTATIONS IN DOWNSTREAM MODELS WITH SIWRS FOR APPLICATIONS. WE EVALUATE SIWRS ON THREE INFORMATION EXTRACTION TASKS, NAMELY NESTED NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION (NER), BINARY AND N-ARY RELATION EXTRACTIONS (RES). THE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT OUR SIWRS YIELD PERFORMANCE GAINS OVER THE BASE REPRESENTATIONS IN THESE NLP TASKS WITH 3-9% RELATIVE ERROR REDUCTION. OUR SIWRS ALSO PERFORM BETTER THAN FINE-TUNING BERT IN BINARY RE. WE ALSO CONDUCT EXTENSIVE EXPERIMENTS TO ANALYSE THE PROPOSED METHOD.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
SYSTEMATIC CHARACTERIZATION AND PREDICTION OF COENZYME A-ASSOCIATED PROTEINS USING SEQUENCE AND NETWORK INFORMATION. COENZYME A-ASSOCIATED PROTEINS (CAPS) ARE A CATEGORY OF FUNCTIONALLY IMPORTANT PROTEINS INVOLVED IN MULTIPLE BIOLOGICAL PROCESSES THROUGH INTERACTIONS WITH COENZYME A (COA). TO DATE, UNFORTUNATELY, THE SPECIFIC DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CAPS AND OTHER PROTEINS HAVE YET TO BE SYSTEMICALLY INVESTIGATED. MOREOVER, THERE ARE NO COMPUTATIONAL METHODS THAT CAN BE USED SPECIFICALLY TO PREDICT THESE PROTEINS. HEREIN, WE CHARACTERIZED CAPS FROM MULTIFACETED VIEWPOINTS AND REVEALED THEIR SPECIFIC PREFERENCES. COMPARED WITH OTHER PROTEINS, CAPS WERE MORE LIKELY TO POSSESS BINDING REGIONS FOR COA AND ITS DERIVATIVES, WERE EVOLUTIONARILY HIGHLY CONSERVED, EXHIBITED ORDERED AND HYDROPHOBIC STRUCTURAL CONFORMATIONS, AND TENDED TO BE DENSELY LOCATED IN PROTEIN-PROTEIN INTERACTION NETWORKS. BASED ON THESE BIOLOGICAL INSIGHTS, WE BUILT SEVEN CLASSIFIERS USING PREDICTED COA-BINDING RESIDUE DISTRIBUTIONS, WORD EMBEDDING VECTORS, REMOTE HOMOLOG NUMBERS, EVOLUTIONARY CONSERVATION, AMINO ACID COMPOSITION, PREDICTED STRUCTURAL FEATURES AND NETWORK PROPERTIES. THESE CLASSIFIERS COULD EFFECTIVELY IDENTIFY CAPS IN HOMO SAPIENS, MUS MUSCULUS AND ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA. THE COMPLEMENTARITY AMONG THE INDIVIDUAL CLASSIFIERS PROMPTED US TO BUILD A TWO-LAYER STACKING MODEL NAMED CAPE FOR IMPROVING PREDICTION PERFORMANCE. WE APPLIED CAPE TO IDENTIFY SOME HIGH-CONFIDENCE CANDIDATES IN THE THREE SPECIES, WHICH WERE TIGHTLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE KNOWN FUNCTIONS OF CAPS. FINALLY, WE EXTENDED OUR ALGORITHM TO CROSS-SPECIES PREDICTION, THEREBY DEVELOPING A GENERIC CAP PREDICTION MODEL. IN SUMMARY, THIS WORK PROVIDES A COMPREHENSIVE SURVEY AND AN EFFECTIVE PREDICTOR FOR CAPS, WHICH CAN HELP UNCOVER THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN COA AND FUNCTIONALLY RELEVANT PROTEINS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
TECHNICAL NOTE: AN EMBEDDING-BASED MEDICAL NOTE DE-IDENTIFICATION APPROACH WITH SPARSE ANNOTATION. PURPOSE: MEDICAL NOTE DE-IDENTIFICATION IS CRITICAL FOR THE PROTECTION OF PRIVATE INFORMATION AND THE SECURITY OF DATA SHARING IN COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH. THE TASK DEMANDS THE COMPLETE REMOVAL OF ALL PATIENT NAMES AND OTHER SENSITIVE INFORMATION SUCH AS ADDRESSES AND PHONE NUMBERS FROM MEDICAL RECORDS. ACCOMPLISHING THIS GOAL IS CHALLENGING, WITH MANY VARIATIONS IN THE MEDICAL NOTE FORMATS AND STRING REPRESENTATIONS. EXISTING DE-IDENTIFICATION APPROACHES INCLUDE PATTERN MATCHING WHERE EXTENSIVE DICTIONARY LISTS ARE CONSTRUCTED A PRIOR; AND ENTITY TAGGING, WHICH TRAINS ON A LARGE WORD-WISE ANNOTATED CORPUS. THIS MOTIVATES US TO STUDY AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE EXISTING APPROACHES WITH A REDUCED ANNOTATION BURDEN. METHODS: IN THIS WORK, WE PROPOSE A NOVEL APPROACH THAT IMPLICITLY ACCOUNTS FOR THE LANGUAGE TERRITORY OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION. SPECIFICALLY, OUR APPROACH INCORPORATES A CONTEXTUALIZED WORD EMBEDDING MODULE AND A MULTILAYER PERCEPTRON TO SIMULTANEOUSLY INFER THE SIMILARITY OF SENSITIVE AND NON-SENSITIVE VOCABULARIES TO A CONSTRUCTED LANDMARK SET, PROVIDING AN OVERALL SPARSELY SUPERVISED CLASSIFICATION. TO DEMONSTRATE THE RATIONALE, WE PRESENT THE PRINCIPLE AND WORK PIPELINE WITH THE TASK OF NAME REMOVAL, BUT THE PROPOSED METHOD APPLIES TO OTHER STRINGS AS WELL. RESULTS: ON A LARGE COHORT OF HYBRID CLINICAL REPORTS, INCLUDING VARIOUS FORMS OF CONSULTING, ON-TREATMENT-VISIT, AND FOLLOW-UP NOTES, WE ACHIEVED >0.99 ACCURACIES IN OUR CONSTRUCTED TRAINING, VALIDATION, AND TESTING SETS. THE SENSITIVITY AND SPECIFICITY WERE 1.0 AND 0.9973, RESPECTIVELY, FOR TWO RANDOMLY SELECTED REPORTS, COMPARING FAVORABLY TO THE BENCHMARK STANFORD NER TAGGER, WHICH ACHIEVED 0.8529 AND 0.9969. THE F1 SCORE WAS 0.889 +/- 0.046 AND 0.822 +/- 0.103 ACROSS SIX RANDOMLY SELECTED REPORTS FOR THE PROPOSED METHOD AND THE STANFORD NER, RESPECTIVELY, AND THE RESULT WAS SIGNIFICANT UNDER A ONE-SIDED T-TEST WITH ALPHA = 0.1. CONCLUSION: OUR QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT OUR METHOD ACHIEVED BETTER RESULTS THAN THE PRETRAINED 3-CLASS STANFORD NER TOOLBOX.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
TEXT CLASSIFICATION FOR CLINICAL TRIAL OPERATIONS: EVALUATION AND COMPARISON OF NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING TECHNIQUES. THE ABILITY TO DETECT PATTERNS AND TRENDS ACROSS PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS (PDS) IS KEY TO ENSURE HIGH DATA QUALITY AND SUFFICIENT OVERSIGHT OF PATIENT SAFETY. IN CLINICAL TRIAL OPERATIONS, SOME BUSINESS PROCESSES AND WORK INSTRUCTIONS LIMIT EFFICIENT PROTOCOL DEVIATION TRENDING BECAUSE A MAJORITY OF PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS ARE LEFT UNCLASSIFIED. WHEN THIS OCCURS, IT RESTRICTS CLINICAL TEAMS FROM DETERMINING SYSTEMIC ISSUES OR SIGNALS IN THE DATA. THE UNSTRUCTURED TEXT IN PROTOCOL DEVIATION DESCRIPTIONS IS AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF TRIAL OPERATION KNOWLEDGE. NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) CAN MAKE PROTOCOL DEVIATION DESCRIPTIONS MORE ACCESSIBLE AND CAN SUPPORT INFORMATION EXTRACTION AND TRENDING ANALYSIS. THIS PAPER REVIEWS HOW THE NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING TECHNIQUES OF TERM-FREQUENCY INVERSE-DOCUMENT-FREQUENCY (TF-IDF) COMBINED WITH THE SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING MODEL OF SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES (SVM) AND WORD EMBEDDING APPROACHES SUCH AS WORD2VEC CAN BE USED TO CATEGORIZE/LABEL PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS ACROSS MULTIPLE THERAPEUTIC AREAS. NLP IS A KEY TOOL THAT WILL LEAD TO MORE DATA DRIVEN DECISIONS IN CLINICAL TRIAL OPERATIONS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
TEXT MINING AND WORD EMBEDDING FOR CLASSIFICATION OF DECISION MAKING VARIABLES IN BREAST CANCER SURGERY. INTRODUCTION: DECISION MAKING IN SURGICAL ONCOLOGY OF THE BREAST HAS INCREASED ITS COMPLEXITY OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS. THIS DELPHI SURVEY INVESTIGATES THE OPINION OF AN EXPERT PANEL ABOUT THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS IN SURGICAL PROCEDURES ON THE BREAST FOR ONCOLOGICAL PURPOSES. METHODS: TWENTY-SEVEN EXPERTS WERE INVITED TO PARTAKE INTO A DELPHI SURVEY. AT THE FIRST ROUND THEY HAVE BEEN ASKED TO PROVIDE A LIST OF FEATURES INVOLVED IN THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS (PATIENT'S CHARACTERISTICS; DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS; SURGICAL TECHNIQUES, OUTCOMES) AND COMMENT ON IT. USING TEXT-MINING TECHNIQUES WE EXTRACTED A LIST OF MONO-BI-TRIGRAMS POTENTIALLY REPRESENTATIVE OF DECISION DRIVERS. A TECHNIQUE OF "NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING" CALLED WORD2VEC WAS USED TO VALIDATE CHANGES TO TEXTS USING SYNONYMS AND PLESIONYMS. WORD2VEC WAS ALSO USED TO TEST THE SEMANTIC RELEVANCE OF N-GRAMS WITHIN A CORPUS OF KNOWLEDGE MADE UP OF BOOKS EDITED BY PANEL MEMBERS. THE FINAL LIST OF VARIABLES EXTRACTED WAS SUBMITTED TO THE JUDGEMENT OF THE PANEL FOR FINAL VALIDATION AT THE SECOND ROUND OF THE DELPHI USING CLOSED ENDED QUESTIONS. RESULTS: 52 FEATURES OUT OF 59 HAVE BEEN APPROVED BY THE PANEL. THE OVERALL CONSENSUS WAS 87.1% CONCLUSIONS: TEXT MINING AND NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING ALLOWED THE EXTRACTION OF A NUMBER OF DECISION DRIVERS AND OUTCOMES AS PART OF THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS IN SURGICAL ONCOLOGY ON THE BREAST. THIS RESULT WAS OBTAINED TRANSFORMING NARRATIVE TEXTS INTO STRUCTURED DATA. THE HIGH LEVEL OF CONSENSUS AMONG EXPERTS PROVIDED VALIDATION TO THIS PROCESS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
TEXT MINING-BASED WORD REPRESENTATIONS FOR BIOMEDICAL DATA ANALYSIS AND PROTEIN-PROTEIN INTERACTION NETWORKS IN MACHINE LEARNING TASKS. BIOMEDICAL AND LIFE SCIENCE LITERATURE IS AN ESSENTIAL WAY TO PUBLISH EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS. WITH THE RAPID GROWTH OF THE NUMBER OF NEW PUBLICATIONS, THE AMOUNT OF SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTED IN FREE TEXT IS INCREASING REMARKABLY. THERE HAS BEEN MUCH INTEREST IN DEVELOPING TECHNIQUES THAT CAN EXTRACT THIS KNOWLEDGE AND MAKE IT ACCESSIBLE TO AID SCIENTISTS IN DISCOVERING NEW RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN BIOLOGICAL ENTITIES AND ANSWERING BIOLOGICAL QUESTIONS. MAKING USE OF THE WORD2VEC APPROACH, WE GENERATED WORD VECTOR REPRESENTATIONS BASED ON A CORPUS CONSISTING OF OVER 16 MILLION PUBMED ABSTRACTS. WE DEVELOPED A TEXT MINING PIPELINE TO PRODUCE WORD2VEC EMBEDDINGS WITH DIFFERENT PROPERTIES AND PERFORMED VALIDATION EXPERIMENTS TO ASSESS THEIR UTILITY FOR BIOMEDICAL ANALYSIS. AN IMPORTANT PRE-PROCESSING STEP CONSISTED IN THE SUBSTITUTION OF SYNONYMOUS TERMS BY THEIR PREFERRED TERMS IN BIOMEDICAL DATABASES. FURTHERMORE, WE EXTRACTED GENE-GENE NETWORKS FROM TWO EMBEDDING VERSIONS AND USED THEM AS PRIOR KNOWLEDGE TO TRAIN GRAPH-CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS (CNNS) ON LARGE BREAST CANCER GENE EXPRESSION DATA AND ON OTHER CANCER DATASETS. PERFORMANCES OF RESULTING MODELS WERE COMPARED TO GRAPH-CNNS TRAINED WITH PROTEIN-PROTEIN INTERACTION (PPI) NETWORKS OR WITH NETWORKS DERIVED USING OTHER WORD EMBEDDING ALGORITHMS. WE ALSO ASSESSED THE EFFECT OF CORPUS SIZE ON THE VARIABILITY OF WORD REPRESENTATIONS. FINALLY, WE CREATED A WEB SERVICE WITH A GRAPHICAL AND A RESTFUL INTERFACE TO EXTRACT AND EXPLORE RELATIONS BETWEEN BIOMEDICAL TERMS USING ANNOTATED EMBEDDINGS. COMPARISONS TO BIOLOGICAL DATABASES SHOWED THAT RELATIONS BETWEEN ENTITIES SUCH AS KNOWN PPIS, SIGNALING PATHWAYS AND CELLULAR FUNCTIONS, OR NARROWER DISEASE ONTOLOGY GROUPS CORRELATED WITH HIGHER COSINE SIMILARITY. GRAPH-CNNS TRAINED WITH WORD2VEC-EMBEDDING-DERIVED NETWORKS PERFORMED SUFFICIENTLY GOOD FOR THE METASTATIC EVENT PREDICTION TASKS COMPARED TO OTHER NETWORKS. SUCH PERFORMANCE WAS GOOD ENOUGH TO VALIDATE THE UTILITY OF OUR GENERATED WORD EMBEDDINGS IN CONSTRUCTING BIOLOGICAL NETWORKS. WORD REPRESENTATIONS AS PRODUCED BY TEXT MINING ALGORITHMS LIKE WORD2VEC, THEREFORE ARE ABLE TO CAPTURE BIOLOGICALLY MEANINGFUL RELATIONS BETWEEN ENTITIES. OUR GENERATED EMBEDDINGS ARE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE AT HTTPS://GITHUB.COM/GENEXPLAIN/WORD2VEC-BASED-NETWORKS/BLOB/MAIN/README.MD.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
TEXT SEMANTIC CLASSIFICATION OF LONG DISCOURSES BASED ON NEURAL NETWORKS WITH IMPROVED FOCAL LOSS. SEMANTIC CLASSIFICATION OF CHINESE LONG DISCOURSES IS AN IMPORTANT AND CHALLENGING TASK. DISCOURSE TEXT IS HIGH-DIMENSIONAL AND SPARSE. FURTHERMORE, WHEN THE NUMBER OF CLASSES OF DATASET IS LARGE, THE DATA DISTRIBUTION WILL BE SERIOUSLY IMBALANCED. IN SOLVING THESE PROBLEMS, WE PROPOSE A NOVEL END-TO-END MODEL CALLED CRAFL, WHICH IS BASED ON THE CONVOLUTIONAL LAYER WITH ATTENTION MECHANISM, RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORKS, AND IMPROVED FOCAL LOSS FUNCTION. FIRST, THE RESIDUAL NETWORK (RESNET) EXTRACTS PHRASE SEMANTIC REPRESENTATIONS FROM WORD EMBEDDING VECTORS AND REDUCES THE DIMENSIONALITY OF THE INPUT MATRIX. THEN, THE ATTENTION MECHANISM DIFFERENTIATES THE FOCUS ON THE OUTPUT OF RESNET, AND THE LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY LAYER LEARNS THE FEATURES OF THE SEQUENCES. LASTLY BUT MOST SIGNIFICANTLY, WE APPLY AN IMPROVED FOCAL LOSS FUNCTION TO MITIGATE THE PROBLEM OF DATA CLASS IMBALANCE. OUR MODEL IS COMPARED WITH OTHER STATE-OF-THE-ART MODELS ON THE LONG DISCOURSE DATASET, AND CRAFL MODEL HAS PROVEN BE MORE EFFICIENT FOR THIS TASK.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
TEXTRANK KEYWORD EXTRACTION ALGORITHM USING WORD VECTOR CLUSTERING BASED ON ROUGH DATA-DEDUCTION. WHEN TEXTRANK ALGORITHM BASED ON GRAPH MODEL CONSTRUCTS GRAPH ASSOCIATIVE EDGES, THE CO-OCCURRENCE WINDOW RULES ONLY CONSIDER THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN LOCAL TERMS. USING THE INFORMATION IN THE DOCUMENT ITSELF IS LIMITED. IN ORDER TO SOLVE THE ABOVE PROBLEMS, AN IMPROVED TEXTRANK KEYWORD EXTRACTION ALGORITHM BASED ON ROUGH DATA REASONING COMBINED WITH WORD VECTOR CLUSTERING, RDD-WRANK, WAS PROPOSED. FIRSTLY, THE ALGORITHM USES ROUGH DATA REASONING TO MINE THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN CANDIDATE KEYWORDS, EXPANDS THE SEARCH SCOPE, AND MAKES THE RESULTS MORE COMPREHENSIVE. THEN, BASED ON WIKIPEDIA ONLINE OPEN KNOWLEDGE BASE, WORD EMBEDDING TECHNOLOGY IS USED TO INTEGRATE WORD2VEC INTO THE IMPROVED ALGORITHM, AND THE WORD VECTOR OF TEXTRANK LEXICAL GRAPH NODES IS CLUSTERED TO ADJUST THE VOTING IMPORTANCE OF NODES IN THE CLUSTER. COMPARED WITH THE TRADITIONAL TEXTRANK ALGORITHM AND THE WORD2VEC ALGORITHM COMBINED WITH TEXTRANK, THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS SHOW THAT THE IMPROVED ALGORITHM HAS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED THE EXTRACTION ACCURACY, WHICH PROVES THAT THE IDEA OF USING ROUGH DATA REASONING CAN EFFECTIVELY IMPROVE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE ALGORITHM TO EXTRACT KEYWORDS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
THE APPLICATION OF PROJECTION WORD EMBEDDINGS ON MEDICAL RECORDS SCORING SYSTEM. MEDICAL RECORDS SCORING IS IMPORTANT IN A HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) WITH PROJECTION WORD EMBEDDINGS HAS BEEN VALIDATED IN ITS PERFORMANCE DISEASE CODING TASKS, WHICH MAINTAIN THE VOCABULARY DIVERSITY OF OPEN INTERNET DATABASES AND THE MEDICAL TERMINOLOGY UNDERSTANDING OF ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS (EHRS). WE CONSIDERED THAT AN AI-ENHANCED SYSTEM MIGHT BE ALSO APPLIED TO AUTOMATICALLY SCORE MEDICAL RECORDS. THIS STUDY AIMED TO DEVELOP A SERIES OF DEEP LEARNING MODELS (DLMS) AND VALIDATED THEIR PERFORMANCE IN MEDICAL RECORDS SCORING TASK. WE ALSO ANALYZED THE PRACTICAL VALUE OF THE BEST MODEL. WE USED THE ADMISSION MEDICAL RECORDS FROM THE TRI-SERVICES GENERAL HOSPITAL DURING JANUARY 2016 TO MAY 2020, WHICH WERE SCORED BY OUR VISITING STAFFS WITH DIFFERENT LEVELS FROM DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS. THE MEDICAL RECORDS WERE SCORED RANGED 0 TO 10. ALL SAMPLES WERE DIVIDED INTO A TRAINING SET (N = 74,959) AND TESTING SET (N = 152,730) BASED ON TIME, WHICH WERE USED TO TRAIN AND VALIDATE THE DLMS, RESPECTIVELY. THE MEAN ABSOLUTE ERROR (MAE) WAS USED TO EVALUATE EACH DLM PERFORMANCE. IN ORIGINAL AI MEDICAL RECORD SCORING, THE PREDICTED SCORE BY BERT ARCHITECTURE IS CLOSER TO THE ACTUAL REVIEWER SCORE THAN THE PROJECTION WORD EMBEDDING AND LSTM ARCHITECTURE. THE ORIGINAL MAE IS 0.84 +/- 0.27 USING THE BERT MODEL, AND THE MAE IS 1.00 +/- 0.32 USING THE LSTM MODEL. LINEAR MIXED MODEL CAN BE USED TO IMPROVE THE MODEL PERFORMANCE, AND THE ADJUSTED PREDICTED SCORE WAS CLOSER COMPARED TO THE ORIGINAL SCORE. HOWEVER, THE PROJECT WORD EMBEDDING WITH THE LSTM MODEL (0.66 +/- 0.39) PROVIDED BETTER PERFORMANCE COMPARED TO BERT (0.70 +/- 0.33) AFTER LINEAR MIXED MODEL ENHANCEMENT (P < 0.001). IN ADDITION TO COMPARING DIFFERENT ARCHITECTURES TO SCORE THE MEDICAL RECORDS, THIS STUDY FURTHER USES A MIXED LINEAR MODEL TO SUCCESSFULLY ADJUST THE AI MEDICAL RECORD SCORE TO MAKE IT CLOSER TO THE ACTUAL PHYSICIAN'S SCORE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
THE CINDERELLA COMPLEX: WORD EMBEDDINGS REVEAL GENDER STEREOTYPES IN MOVIES AND BOOKS. OUR ANALYSIS OF THOUSANDS OF MOVIES AND BOOKS REVEALS HOW THESE CULTURAL PRODUCTS WEAVE STEREOTYPICAL GENDER ROLES INTO MORALITY TALES AND PERPETUATE GENDER INEQUALITY THROUGH STORYTELLING. USING THE WORD EMBEDDING TECHNIQUES, WE REVEAL THE CONSTRUCTED EMOTIONAL DEPENDENCY OF FEMALE CHARACTERS ON MALE CHARACTERS IN STORIES. WE CALL THIS NARRATIVE STRUCTURE "CINDERELLA COMPLEX", WHICH ASSUMES THAT WOMEN DEPEND ON MEN IN THE PURSUIT OF A HAPPY, FULFILLING LIFE. OUR ANALYSIS COVERS A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF NARRATIVES THAT SHAPE THE MODERN COLLECTIVE MEMORY, INCLUDING 7,226 BOOKS, 6,087 MOVIE SYNOPSES, AND 1,109 MOVIE SCRIPTS. THE "CINDERELLA COMPLEX" IS OBSERVED TO EXIST WIDELY ACROSS PERIODS AND CONTEXTS, REMINDING HOW GENDER STEREOTYPES ARE DEEPLY ROOTED IN OUR SOCIETY. OUR ANALYSIS OF THE WORDS SURROUNDING FEMALE AND MALE CHARACTERS SHOWS THAT THE LIVES OF MALES ARE ADVENTURE-ORIENTED, WHEREAS THE LIVES OF FEMALES ARE ROMANTIC-RELATIONSHIP ORIENTED. FINALLY, WE DEMONSTRATE THE SOCIAL ENDORSEMENT OF GENDER STEREOTYPES BY SHOWING THAT GENDER-STEREOTYPICAL MOVIES ARE VOTED MORE FREQUENTLY AND RATED HIGHER.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
THE COMPOSITIONALITY OF FACIAL EXPRESSIONS. THE PRINCIPLE OF COMPOSITIONALITY, AN IMPORTANT POSTULATION IN LANGUAGE AND COGNITION RESEARCH, POSITS THAT THE MEANING OF A COMPLEX EXPRESSION IS DETERMINED BY THE MEANING OF ITS CONSTITUTING PARTS AND THE OPERATION PERFORMED ON THOSE PARTS. HERE, WE PROVIDE STRONG EVIDENCE THAT THIS PRINCIPLE PLAYS A SIGNIFICANT ROLE ALSO IN INTERPRETING FACIAL EXPRESSIONS. IN THREE STUDIES IN WHICH PERCEIVERS INTERPRETED SEQUENCES OF TWO EMOTIONAL FACIAL EXPRESSION IMAGES, WE SHOW THAT THE COMPOSITE MEANING OF FACIAL EXPRESSIONS RESULTS FROM THE MEANING OF ITS CONSTITUTING EXPRESSIONS AND AN ALGEBRAIC OPERATION PERFORMED ON THOSE EXPRESSIONS. OUR STUDY OFFERS A SYSTEMATIC ACCOUNT AS TO HOW THE MEANING OF FACIAL EXPRESSIONS (SINGLE AND SEQUENCES) ARE BEING FORMED AND PERCEIVED. IN A BROADER CONTEXT, OUR RESULTS RAISE THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE PRINCIPLE OF COMPOSITIONALITY MAY APPLY TO HUMAN COMMUNICATION MODALITIES BEYOND SPOKEN LANGUAGE, WHEREBY A MINIMAL NUMBER OF COMPONENTS ARE EXPANDED TO A MUCH GREATER NUMBER OF MEANINGS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
THE DESIGN, CONSTRUCTION AND EVALUATION OF ANNOTATED ARABIC CYBERBULLYING CORPUS. CYBERBULLYING (CB) IS CLASSIFIED AS ONE OF THE SEVERE MISCONDUCTS ON SOCIAL MEDIA. MANY CB DETECTION SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED FOR MANY NATURAL LANGUAGES TO FACE THIS PHENOMENON. HOWEVER, ARABIC IS ONE OF THE UNDER-RESOURCED LANGUAGES SUFFERING FROM THE LACK OF QUALITY DATASETS IN MANY COMPUTATIONAL RESEARCH AREAS. THIS PAPER DISCUSSES THE DESIGN, CONSTRUCTION, AND EVALUATION OF A MULTI-DIALECT, ANNOTATED ARABIC CYBERBULLYING CORPUS (ARCYBC), A VALUABLE RESOURCE FOR ARABIC CB DETECTION AND MOTIVATION FOR FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS IN ARABIC NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP). THE STUDY DESCRIBES THE PHASES OF ARCYBC COMPILATION. BY WAY OF ILLUSTRATION, IT EXPLORES THE CORPUS TO DISCOVER STRATEGIES USED IN RENDERING ARABIC CB TWEETS PULLED FROM FOUR TWITTER GROUPS, INCLUDING GAMING, SPORTS, NEWS, AND CELEBRITIES. BASED ON THOROUGH ANALYSIS, WE DISCOVERED THAT THESE GROUPS WERE THE MOST SUSCEPTIBLE TO HARASSMENT AND CYBERBULLYING. THE COLLECTED TWEETS WERE FILTERED BASED ON A COMPILED HARASSMENT LEXICON, WHICH CONTAINS A LIST OF MULTI-DIALECTICAL PROFANE WORDS IN ARABIC COMPILED FROM FOUR CATEGORIES: SEXUAL, RACIAL, PHYSICAL APPEARANCE, AND INTELLIGENCE. TO ANNOTATE ARCYBC, WE ASKED FIVE ANNOTATORS TO CLASSIFY 4,505 TWEETS INTO TWO CLASSES MANUALLY: OFFENSIVE/NON-OFFENSIVE AND CB/NON-CB. WE CONDUCTED A RIGOROUS COMPARISON OF DIFFERENT MACHINE LEARNING APPROACHES APPLIED ON ARCYBC TO DETECT ARABIC CB USING TWO LANGUAGE MODELS: BAG-OF-WORDS (BOW) AND WORD EMBEDDING. THE EXPERIMENTS SHOWED THAT SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE (SVM) WITH WORD EMBEDDING ACHIEVED AN ACCURACY RATE OF 86.3% AND AN F1-SCORE RATE OF 85%. THE MAIN CHALLENGES ENCOUNTERED DURING THE ARCYBC CONSTRUCTION WERE THE SCARCITY OF FREELY AVAILABLE ARABIC CB TEXTS AND THE DEFICIENCY OF ANNOTATING THE TEXTS.

METHODS: IN THIS STUDY, THE APPLICABILITY OF THE MOST COMMON STRING SIMILARITY MEASURES WERE ANALYZED AND COMPARED FOR THE KEYWORD-BASED MEDICAL TEXT SEARCH. RESULTS: THE USEFULNESS OF THE SIMILARITY MEASURES WAS STUDIED IN A SET OF MEDICAL DOCUMENTS CONTAINING MORE THAN 20,000 ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY REPORTS. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE JARO-WINKLER DISSIMILARITY MEASURE IS THE MOST CAPABLE MEASURE TO EXPLORE THE CONTENT OF THE MEDICAL TEXTS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
THE EMERGENCE OF GENDER ASSOCIATIONS IN CHILD LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT. GENDER ASSOCIATIONS HAVE BEEN A LONG-STANDING RESEARCH TOPIC IN PSYCHOLOGICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCES. ALTHOUGH IT IS KNOWN THAT CHILDREN LEARN ASPECTS OF GENDER ASSOCIATIONS AT A YOUNG AGE, IT IS NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD HOW THEY MIGHT EMERGE THROUGH THE COURSE OF DEVELOPMENT. WE INVESTIGATE WHETHER GENDER ASSOCIATIONS, SUCH AS THE ASSOCIATION OF DRESSES WITH WOMEN AND BULLDOZERS WITH MEN, ARE REFLECTED IN THE LINGUISTIC COMMUNICATION OF YOUNG CHILDREN FROM AGES 1-5. DRAWING ON RECENT METHODS FROM MACHINE LEARNING, WE USE WORD EMBEDDINGS DERIVED FROM LARGE TEXT CORPORA INCLUDING NEWS ARTICLES AND WEB PAGES AS A PROXY FOR GENDER ASSOCIATIONS IN SOCIETY, AND WE COMPARE THOSE WITH THE GENDER ASSOCIATIONS OF WORDS UTTERED BY CARETAKERS AND CHILDREN IN CHILDREN'S LINGUISTIC ENVIRONMENT. WE QUANTIFY GENDER ASSOCIATIONS IN CHILDHOOD LANGUAGE THROUGH GENDER PROBABILITY, WHICH MEASURES THE EXTENT TO WHICH WORD USAGE FREQUENCIES IN SPEECH TO AND BY GIRLS AND BOYS ARE GENDER-SKEWED. BY ANALYZING 4,875 NATURAL CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN CHILDREN AND THEIR CARETAKERS IN NORTH AMERICA, WE FIND THAT FREQUENCY PATTERNS IN WORD USAGE OF BOTH CARETAKERS AND CHILDREN CORRELATE STRONGLY WITH THE GENDER ASSOCIATIONS CAPTURED IN WORD EMBEDDINGS THROUGH THE COURSE OF DEVELOPMENT. WE DISCOVER THAT THESE CORRELATIONS DIMINISH FROM THE 1970S TO THE 1990S. OUR WORK SUGGESTS THAT EARLY LINGUISTIC COMMUNICATION AND SOCIAL CHANGES MAY JOINTLY CONTRIBUTE TO THE FORMATION OF GENDER ASSOCIATIONS IN CHILDHOOD.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
THE H-ANN MODEL: COMPREHENSIVE COLONOSCOPY CONCEPT COMPILATION USING COMBINED CONTEXTUAL EMBEDDINGS. COLONOSCOPY IS A SCREENING AND DIAGNOSTIC PROCEDURE FOR DETECTION OF COLORECTAL CARCINOMAS WITH SPECIFIC QUALITY METRICS THAT MONITOR AND IMPROVE ADENOMA DETECTION RATES. THESE QUALITY METRICS ARE STORED IN DISPARATE DOCUMENTS I.E., COLONOSCOPY, PATHOLOGY, AND RADIOLOGY REPORTS. THE LACK OF INTEGRATED STANDARDIZED DOCUMENTATION IS IMPEDING COLORECTAL CANCER RESEARCH. CLINICAL CONCEPT EXTRACTION USING NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) AND MACHINE LEARNING (ML) TECHNIQUES IS AN ALTERNATIVE TO MANUAL DATA ABSTRACTION. CONTEXTUAL WORD EMBEDDING MODELS SUCH AS BERT (BIDIRECTIONAL ENCODER REPRESENTATIONS FROM TRANSFORMERS) AND FLAIR HAVE ENHANCED PERFORMANCE OF NLP TASKS. COMBINING MULTIPLE CLINICALLY-TRAINED EMBEDDINGS CAN IMPROVE WORD REPRESENTATIONS AND BOOST THE PERFORMANCE OF THE CLINICAL NLP SYSTEMS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY IS TO EXTRACT COMPREHENSIVE CLINICAL CONCEPTS FROM THE CONSOLIDATED COLONOSCOPY DOCUMENTS USING CONCATENATED CLINICAL EMBEDDINGS. WE BUILT HIGH-QUALITY ANNOTATED CORPORA FOR THREE REPORT TYPES. BERT AND FLAIR EMBEDDINGS WERE TRAINED ON UNLABELED COLONOSCOPY RELATED DOCUMENTS. WE BUILT A HYBRID ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK (H-ANN) TO CONCATENATE AND FINE-TUNE BERT AND FLAIR EMBEDDINGS. TO EXTRACT CONCEPTS OF INTEREST FROM THREE REPORT TYPES, 3 MODELS WERE INITIALIZED FROM THE H-ANN AND FINE-TUNED USING THE ANNOTATED CORPORA. THE MODELS ACHIEVED BEST F1-SCORES OF 91.76%, 92.25%, AND 88.55% FOR COLONOSCOPY, PATHOLOGY, AND RADIOLOGY REPORTS RESPECTIVELY.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
THE IMPACT OF PRETRAINED LANGUAGE MODELS ON NEGATION AND SPECULATION DETECTION IN CROSS-LINGUAL MEDICAL TEXT: COMPARATIVE STUDY. BACKGROUND: NEGATION AND SPECULATION ARE CRITICAL ELEMENTS IN NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP)-RELATED TASKS, SUCH AS INFORMATION EXTRACTION, AS THESE PHENOMENA CHANGE THE TRUTH VALUE OF A PROPOSITION. IN THE CLINICAL NARRATIVE THAT IS INFORMAL, THESE LINGUISTIC FACTS ARE USED EXTENSIVELY WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF INDICATING HYPOTHESES, IMPRESSIONS, OR NEGATIVE FINDINGS. PREVIOUS STATE-OF-THE-ART APPROACHES ADDRESSED NEGATION AND SPECULATION DETECTION TASKS USING RULE-BASED METHODS, BUT IN THE LAST FEW YEARS, MODELS BASED ON MACHINE LEARNING AND DEEP LEARNING EXPLOITING MORPHOLOGICAL, SYNTACTIC, AND SEMANTIC FEATURES REPRESENTED AS SPARE AND DENSE VECTORS HAVE EMERGED. HOWEVER, ALTHOUGH SUCH METHODS OF NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION (NER) EMPLOY A BROAD SET OF FEATURES, THEY ARE LIMITED TO EXISTING PRETRAINED MODELS FOR A SPECIFIC DOMAIN OR LANGUAGE. OBJECTIVE: AS A FUNDAMENTAL SUBSYSTEM OF ANY INFORMATION EXTRACTION PIPELINE, A SYSTEM FOR CROSS-LINGUAL AND DOMAIN-INDEPENDENT NEGATION AND SPECULATION DETECTION WAS INTRODUCED WITH SPECIAL FOCUS ON THE BIOMEDICAL SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE AND CLINICAL NARRATIVE. IN THIS WORK, DETECTION OF NEGATION AND SPECULATION WAS CONSIDERED AS A SEQUENCE-LABELING TASK WHERE CUES AND THE SCOPES OF BOTH PHENOMENA ARE RECOGNIZED AS A SEQUENCE OF NESTED LABELS RECOGNIZED IN A SINGLE STEP. METHODS: WE PROPOSED THE FOLLOWING TWO APPROACHES FOR NEGATION AND SPECULATION DETECTION: (1) BIDIRECTIONAL LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY (BI-LSTM) AND CONDITIONAL RANDOM FIELD USING CHARACTER, WORD, AND SENSE EMBEDDINGS TO DEAL WITH THE EXTRACTION OF SEMANTIC, SYNTACTIC, AND CONTEXTUAL PATTERNS AND (2) BIDIRECTIONAL ENCODER REPRESENTATIONS FOR TRANSFORMERS (BERT) WITH FINE TUNING FOR NER. RESULTS: THE APPROACH WAS EVALUATED FOR ENGLISH AND SPANISH LANGUAGES ON BIOMEDICAL AND REVIEW TEXT, PARTICULARLY WITH THE BIOSCOPE CORPUS, IULA CORPUS, AND SFU SPANISH REVIEW CORPUS, WITH F-MEASURES OF 86.6%, 85.0%, AND 88.1%, RESPECTIVELY, FOR NEURONER AND 86.4%, 80.8%, AND 91.7%, RESPECTIVELY, FOR BERT. CONCLUSIONS: THESE RESULTS SHOW THAT THESE ARCHITECTURES PERFORM CONSIDERABLY BETTER THAN THE PREVIOUS RULE-BASED AND CONVENTIONAL MACHINE LEARNING-BASED SYSTEMS. MOREOVER, OUR ANALYSIS RESULTS SHOW THAT PRETRAINED WORD EMBEDDING AND PARTICULARLY CONTEXTUALIZED EMBEDDING FOR BIOMEDICAL CORPORA HELP TO UNDERSTAND COMPLEXITIES INHERENT TO BIOMEDICAL TEXT.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
THE IMPORTANCE OF TERM WEIGHTING IN SEMANTIC UNDERSTANDING OF TEXT: A REVIEW OF TECHNIQUES. IN THIS PAPER WE REVIEW A WIDE SPECTRUM OF TECHNIQUES WHICH HAVE BEEN PROPOSED IN LITERATURE TO ENABLE ACCEPTABLE RECOGNITION OF LANGUAGE AND TEXT BY MACHINES. WE DISCUSS MANY TECHNIQUES WHICH HAVE BEEN PROPOSED BY RESEARCHERS IN THE FIELD OF TERM WEIGHTING AND EXPLORE THE MATHEMATICAL FOUNDATIONS OF THESE METHODS. TERM WEIGHTING SCHEMES HAVE BROADLY BEEN CLASSIFIED AS SUPERVISED AND STATISTICAL METHODS AND WE PRESENT NUMEROUS EXAMPLES FROM BOTH CATEGORIES TO HIGHLIGHT THE DIFFERENCE IN APPROACHES BETWEEN THE TWO BROAD CATEGORIES. WE PAY PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THE VECTOR SPACE MODEL AND ITS VARIANTS WHICH FORM THE BASIS OF MANY OF THE OTHER METHODS WHICH HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED IN THE PAPER.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
THE INTERPRETATION OF DREAM MEANING: RESOLVING AMBIGUITY USING LATENT SEMANTIC ANALYSIS IN A SMALL CORPUS OF TEXT. COMPUTER-BASED DREAMS CONTENT ANALYSIS RELIES ON WORD FREQUENCIES WITHIN PREDEFINED CATEGORIES IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY DIFFERENT ELEMENTS IN TEXT. AS A COMPLEMENTARY APPROACH, WE EXPLORED THE CAPABILITIES AND LIMITATIONS OF WORD-EMBEDDING TECHNIQUES TO IDENTIFY WORD USAGE PATTERNS AMONG DREAM REPORTS. THESE TOOLS ALLOW US TO QUANTIFY WORDS ASSOCIATIONS IN TEXT AND TO IDENTIFY THE MEANING OF TARGET WORDS. WORD-EMBEDDINGS HAVE BEEN EXTENSIVELY STUDIED IN LARGE DATASETS, BUT ONLY A FEW STUDIES ANALYZE SEMANTIC REPRESENTATIONS IN SMALL CORPORA. TO FILL THIS GAP, WE COMPARED SKIP-GRAM AND LATENT SEMANTIC ANALYSIS (LSA) CAPABILITIES TO EXTRACT SEMANTIC ASSOCIATIONS FROM DREAM REPORTS. LSA SHOWED BETTER PERFORMANCE THAN SKIP-GRAM IN SMALL SIZE CORPORA IN TWO TESTS. FURTHERMORE, LSA CAPTURED RELEVANT WORD ASSOCIATIONS IN DREAM COLLECTION, EVEN IN CASES WITH LOW-FREQUENCY WORDS OR SMALL NUMBERS OF DREAMS. WORD ASSOCIATIONS IN DREAMS REPORTS CAN THUS BE QUANTIFIED BY LSA, WHICH OPENS NEW AVENUES FOR DREAM INTERPRETATION AND DECODING.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
THE LANGUAGE OF DREAMS: APPLICATION OF LINGUISTICS-BASED APPROACHES FOR THE AUTOMATED ANALYSIS OF DREAM EXPERIENCES. THE STUDY OF DREAMS REPRESENTS A CRUCIAL INTERSECTION BETWEEN PHILOSOPHICAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL, NEUROSCIENTIFIC, AND CLINICAL INTERESTS. IMPORTANTLY, ONE OF THE MAIN SOURCES OF INSIGHT INTO DREAMING ACTIVITY ARE THE (ORAL OR WRITTEN) REPORTS PROVIDED BY DREAMERS UPON AWAKENING FROM THEIR SLEEP. CLASSICALLY, TWO MAIN TYPES OF INFORMATION ARE COMMONLY EXTRACTED FROM DREAM REPORTS: STRUCTURAL AND SEMANTIC, CONTENT-RELATED INFORMATION. EXTRACTED STRUCTURAL INFORMATION IS TYPICALLY LIMITED TO THE SIMPLE COUNT OF WORDS OR SENTENCES IN A REPORT. INSTEAD, CONTENT ANALYSIS USUALLY RELIES ON QUANTITATIVE SCORES ASSIGNED BY TWO OR MORE (BLIND) HUMAN OPERATORS THROUGH THE USE OF PREDEFINED CODING SYSTEMS. WITHIN THIS REVIEW, WE WILL SHOW THAT METHODS BORROWED FROM THE FIELD OF LINGUISTIC ANALYSIS, SUCH AS GRAPH ANALYSIS, DICTIONARY-BASED CONTENT ANALYSIS, AND DISTRIBUTIONAL SEMANTICS APPROACHES, COULD BE USED TO COMPLEMENT AND, IN MANY CASES, REPLACE CLASSICAL MEASURES AND SCALES FOR THE QUANTITATIVE STRUCTURAL AND SEMANTIC ASSESSMENT OF DREAM REPORTS. IMPORTANTLY, THESE METHODS ALLOW THE DIRECT (OPERATOR-INDEPENDENT) EXTRACTION OF QUANTITATIVE INFORMATION FROM LANGUAGE DATA, HENCE ENABLING A FULLY OBJECTIVE AND REPRODUCIBLE ANALYSIS OF CONSCIOUS EXPERIENCES OCCURRING DURING HUMAN SLEEP. MOST IMPORTANTLY, THESE APPROACHES CAN BE PARTIALLY OR FULLY AUTOMATIZED AND MAY THUS BE EASILY APPLIED TO THE ANALYSIS OF LARGE DATASETS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
THE LANGUAGE OF PROTEINS: NLP, MACHINE LEARNING & PROTEIN SEQUENCES. NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) IS A FIELD OF COMPUTER SCIENCE CONCERNED WITH AUTOMATED TEXT AND LANGUAGE ANALYSIS. IN RECENT YEARS, FOLLOWING A SERIES OF BREAKTHROUGHS IN DEEP AND MACHINE LEARNING, NLP METHODS HAVE SHOWN OVERWHELMING PROGRESS. HERE, WE REVIEW THE SUCCESS, PROMISE AND PITFALLS OF APPLYING NLP ALGORITHMS TO THE STUDY OF PROTEINS. PROTEINS, WHICH CAN BE REPRESENTED AS STRINGS OF AMINO-ACID LETTERS, ARE A NATURAL FIT TO MANY NLP METHODS. WE EXPLORE THE CONCEPTUAL SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PROTEINS AND LANGUAGE, AND REVIEW A RANGE OF PROTEIN-RELATED TASKS AMENABLE TO MACHINE LEARNING. WE PRESENT METHODS FOR ENCODING THE INFORMATION OF PROTEINS AS TEXT AND ANALYZING IT WITH NLP METHODS, REVIEWING CLASSIC CONCEPTS SUCH AS BAG-OF-WORDS, K-MERS/N-GRAMS AND TEXT SEARCH, AS WELL AS MODERN TECHNIQUES SUCH AS WORD EMBEDDING, CONTEXTUALIZED EMBEDDING, DEEP LEARNING AND NEURAL LANGUAGE MODELS. IN PARTICULAR, WE FOCUS ON RECENT INNOVATIONS SUCH AS MASKED LANGUAGE MODELING, SELF-SUPERVISED LEARNING AND ATTENTION-BASED MODELS. FINALLY, WE DISCUSS TRENDS AND CHALLENGES IN THE INTERSECTION OF NLP AND PROTEIN RESEARCH.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
THE MACROSCOPE: A TOOL FOR EXAMINING THE HISTORICAL STRUCTURE OF LANGUAGE. THE RECENT RISE IN DIGITIZED HISTORICAL TEXT HAS MADE IT POSSIBLE TO QUANTITATIVELY STUDY OUR PSYCHOLOGICAL PAST. THIS INVOLVES UNDERSTANDING CHANGES IN WHAT WORDS MEANT, HOW WORDS WERE USED, AND HOW THESE CHANGES MAY HAVE RESPONDED TO CHANGES IN THE ENVIRONMENT, SUCH AS IN HEALTHCARE, WEALTH DISPARITY, AND WAR. HERE WE MAKE AVAILABLE A TOOL, THE MACROSCOPE, FOR STUDYING HISTORICAL CHANGES IN LANGUAGE OVER THE LAST TWO CENTURIES. THE MACROSCOPE USES OVER 155 BILLION WORDS OF HISTORICAL TEXT, WHICH WILL GROW AS WE INCLUDE NEW HISTORICAL CORPORA, AND DERIVES WORD PROPERTIES FROM FREQUENCY-OF-USAGE AND CO-OCCURRENCE PATTERNS OVER TIME. USING CO-OCCURRENCE PATTERNS, THE MACROSCOPE CAN TRACK CHANGES IN SEMANTICS, ALLOWING RESEARCHERS TO IDENTIFY SEMANTICALLY STABLE AND UNSTABLE WORDS IN HISTORICAL TEXT AND PROVIDING QUANTITATIVE INFORMATION ABOUT CHANGES IN A WORD'S VALENCE, AROUSAL, AND CONCRETENESS, AS WELL AS INFORMATION ABOUT NEW PROPERTIES, SUCH AS SEMANTIC DRIFT. THE MACROSCOPE PROVIDES INFORMATION ABOUT BOTH THE LOCAL AND GLOBAL PROPERTIES OF WORDS, AS WELL AS INFORMATION ABOUT HOW THESE PROPERTIES CHANGE OVER TIME, ALLOWING RESEARCHERS TO VISUALIZE AND DOWNLOAD DATA IN ORDER TO MAKE INFERENCES ABOUT HISTORICAL PSYCHOLOGY. ALTHOUGH QUANTITATIVE HISTORICAL PSYCHOLOGY REPRESENTS A LARGELY NEW FIELD OF STUDY, WE SEE THIS WORK AS COMPLEMENTING A WEALTH OF OTHER HISTORICAL INVESTIGATIONS, OFFERING NEW INSIGHTS AND NEW APPROACHES TO UNDERSTANDING EXISTING THEORY. THE MACROSCOPE IS AVAILABLE ONLINE AT HTTP://WWW.MACROSCOPE.TECH .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
THE MESH-GRAM NEURAL NETWORK MODEL: EXTENDING WORD EMBEDDING VECTORS WITH MESH CONCEPTS FOR SEMANTIC SIMILARITY. ELICITING SEMANTIC SIMILARITY BETWEEN CONCEPTS REMAINS A CHALLENGING TASK. RECENT APPROACHES FOUNDED ON EMBEDDING VECTORS HAVE GAINED IN POPULARITY AS THEY HAVE RISEN TO EFFICIENTLY CAPTURE SEMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS. THE UNDERLYING IDEA IS THAT TWO WORDS THAT HAVE CLOSE MEANING GATHER SIMILAR CONTEXTS. IN THIS STUDY, WE PROPOSE A NEW NEURAL NETWORK MODEL, NAMED MESH-GRAM, WHICH RELIES ON A STRAIGHTFORWARD APPROACH THAT EXTENDS THE SKIP-GRAM NEURAL NETWORK MODEL BY CONSIDERING MESH (MEDICAL SUBJECT HEADINGS) DESCRIPTORS INSTEAD OF WORDS. TRAINED ON PUBLICLY AVAILABLE PUBMED/MEDLINE CORPUS, MESH-GRAM IS EVALUATED ON REFERENCE STANDARDS MANUALLY ANNOTATED FOR SEMANTIC SIMILARITY. MESH-GRAM IS FIRST COMPARED TO SKIP-GRAM WITH VECTORS OF SIZE 300 AND AT SEVERAL WINDOWS' CONTEXTS. A DEEPER COMPARISON IS PERFORMED WITH TWENTY EXISTING MODELS. ALL THE OBTAINED RESULTS WITH SPEARMAN'S RANK CORRELATIONS BETWEEN HUMAN SCORES AND COMPUTED SIMILARITIES SHOW THAT MESH-GRAM (I) OUTPERFORMS THE SKIP-GRAM MODEL AND (II) IS COMPARABLE TO THE BEST METHODS THAT NEED MORE COMPUTATION AND EXTERNAL RESOURCES.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
THE MESSAGE PASSING NEURAL NETWORKS FOR CHEMICAL PROPERTY PREDICTION ON SMILES. DRUG METABOLISM IS DETERMINED BY THE BIOCHEMICAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES OF THE DRUG MOLECULE. TO IMPROVE THE PERFORMANCE OF A DRUG PROPERTY PREDICTION MODEL, IT IS IMPORTANT TO EXTRACT COMPLEX MOLECULAR DYNAMICS FROM LIMITED DATA. RECENT MACHINE LEARNING OR DEEP LEARNING BASED MODELS HAVE EMPLOYED THE ATOM- AND BOND-TYPE INFORMATION, AS WELL AS THE STRUCTURAL INFORMATION TO PREDICT DRUG PROPERTIES. HOWEVER, MANY OF THESE METHODS CAN BE USED ONLY FOR THE GRAPH REPRESENTATIONS. MESSAGE PASSING NEURAL NETWORKS (MPNNS) (GILMER ET AL., 2017) IS A FRAMEWORK USED TO LEARN BOTH LOCAL AND GLOBAL FEATURES FROM IRREGULARLY FORMED DATA, AND IS INVARIANT TO PERMUTATIONS. THIS NETWORK PERFORMS AN ITERATIVE MESSAGE PASSING (MP) OPERATION ON EACH OBJECT AND ITS NEIGHBORS, AND OBTAIN THE FINAL OUTPUT FROM ALL MESSAGES REGARDLESS OF THEIR ORDER. IN THIS STUDY, WE APPLIED THE MP-BASED ATTENTION NETWORK (NIKOLENTZOS ET AL., 2019) ORIGINALLY DEVELOPED FOR TEXT LEARNING TO PERFORM CHEMICAL CLASSIFICATION TASKS. BEFORE TRAINING, WE TOKENIZED THE CHARACTERS, AND OBTAINED EMBEDDINGS OF EACH MOLECULAR SEQUENCE. WE CONDUCTED VARIOUS EXPERIMENTS TO MAXIMIZE THE PREDICTIVITY OF THE MODEL. WE TRAINED AND EVALUATED OUR MODEL USING VARIOUS CHEMICAL CLASSIFICATION BENCHMARK TASKS. OUR RESULTS ARE COMPARABLE TO PREVIOUS STATE-OF-THE-ART AND BASELINE MODELS OR OUTPERFORM. TO THE BEST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE, THIS IS THE FIRST ATTEMPT TO LEARN CHEMICAL STRINGS USING AN MP-BASED ALGORITHM. WE WILL EXTEND OUR WORK TO MORE COMPLEX TASKS SUCH AS REGRESSION OR GENERATION TASKS IN THE FUTURE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
THE PREDICTION OF HOSPITAL LENGTH OF STAY USING UNSTRUCTURED DATA. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY AIMED TO ASSESS THE PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT FOR MACHINE LEARNING-BASED HOSPITAL LENGTH OF STAY (LOS) PREDICTIONS WHEN CLINICAL SIGNS WRITTEN IN TEXT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AND COMPARED TO THE TRADITIONAL APPROACH OF SOLELY CONSIDERING STRUCTURED INFORMATION SUCH AS AGE, GENDER AND MAJOR ICD DIAGNOSIS. METHODS: THIS STUDY WAS AN OBSERVATIONAL RETROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY AND ANALYZED PATIENT STAYS ADMITTED BETWEEN 1 JANUARY TO 24 SEPTEMBER 2019. FOR EACH STAY, A PATIENT WAS ADMITTED THROUGH THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT (ED) AND STAYED FOR MORE THAN TWO DAYS IN THE SUBSEQUENT SERVICE. LOS WAS PREDICTED USING TWO RANDOM FOREST MODELS. THE FIRST INCLUDED UNSTRUCTURED TEXT EXTRACTED FROM ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS (EHRS). A WORD-EMBEDDING ALGORITHM BASED ON UMLS TERMINOLOGY WITH EXACT MATCHING RESTRICTED TO PATIENT-CENTRIC AFFIRMATION SENTENCES WAS USED TO ASSESS THE EHR DATA. THE SECOND MODEL WAS PRIMARILY BASED ON STRUCTURED DATA IN THE FORM OF DIAGNOSES CODED FROM THE INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASE 10TH EDITION (ICD-10) AND TRIAGE CODES (CCMU/GEMSA CLASSIFICATIONS). VARIABLES COMMON TO BOTH MODELS WERE: AGE, GENDER, ZIP/POSTAL CODE, LOS IN THE ED, RECENT VISIT FLAG, ASSIGNED PATIENT WARD AFTER THE ED STAY AND SHORT-TERM ED ACTIVITY. MODELS WERE TRAINED ON 80% OF DATA AND PERFORMANCE WAS EVALUATED BY ACCURACY ON THE REMAINING 20% TEST DATA. RESULTS: THE MODEL USING UNSTRUCTURED DATA HAD A 75.0% ACCURACY COMPARED TO 74.1% FOR THE MODEL CONTAINING STRUCTURED DATA. THE TWO MODELS PRODUCED A SIMILAR PREDICTION IN 86.6% OF CASES. IN A SECONDARY ANALYSIS RESTRICTED TO INTENSIVE CARE PATIENTS, THE ACCURACY OF BOTH MODELS WAS ALSO SIMILAR (76.3% VS 75.0%). CONCLUSIONS: LOS PREDICTION USING UNSTRUCTURED DATA HAD SIMILAR ACCURACY TO USING STRUCTURED DATA AND CAN BE CONSIDERED OF USE TO ACCURATELY MODEL LOS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
THE QUEST FOR BETTER CLINICAL WORD VECTORS: ONTOLOGY BASED AND LEXICAL VECTOR AUGMENTATION VERSUS CLINICAL CONTEXTUAL EMBEDDINGS. BACKGROUND: WORD VECTORS OR WORD EMBEDDINGS ARE N-DIMENSIONAL REPRESENTATIONS OF WORDS AND FORM THE BACKBONE OF NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING OF TEXTUAL DATA. THIS RESEARCH EXPERIMENTS WITH ALGORITHMS THAT AUGMENT WORD VECTORS WITH LEXICAL CONSTRAINTS THAT ARE POPULAR IN NLP RESEARCH AND CLINICAL DOMAIN CONSTRAINTS DERIVED FROM THE UNIFIED MEDICAL LANGUAGE SYSTEM (UMLS). IT ALSO COMPARES THE PERFORMANCE OF THE AUGMENTED VECTORS WITH BIO + CLINICAL BERT VECTORS WHICH HAVE BEEN TRAINED AND FINE-TUNED ON CLINICAL DATASETS. METHODS: WORD2VEC VECTORS ARE GENERATED FOR WORDS IN A PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DE-IDENTIFIED ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS (EHR) DATASET AND AUGMENTED BY ONTOLOGIES USING THREE ALGORITHMS THAT HAVE FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO VECTOR AUGMENTATION. THE AUGMENTED VECTORS ARE THEN EVALUATED ALONGSIDE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE BIO + CLINICAL BERT ON THEIR CORRELATION WITH HUMAN-ANNOTATED LISTS USING SPEARMAN'S CORRELATION COEFFICIENT. THEY ARE ALSO EVALUATED ON THE DOWNSTREAM TASK OF NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION (NER). QUANTITATIVE AND EMPIRICAL EVALUATIONS ARE USED TO HIGHLIGHT THE STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF THE DIFFERENT APPROACHES. RESULTS: THE COUNTER-FITTED WORD2VEC VECTORS AUGMENTED WITH INFORMATION FROM THE UMLS ONTOLOGY PRODUCED THE BEST CORRELATION OVERALL WITH HUMAN-ANNOTATED EVALUATION LISTS (SPEARMAN'S CORRELATION OF 0.733 WITH MINI MAYO-DOCTORS' ANNOTATION) WHILE BIO + CLINICAL BERT PRODUCES THE BEST RESULTS IN THE NER TASK (F1 OF 0.87 AND 0.811 ON THE I2B2 2010 AND I2B2 2012 DATASETS RESPECTIVELY) IN OUR EXPERIMENTS. CONCLUSION: CLINICALLY ADAPTED WORD2VEC VECTORS SUCCESSFULLY ENCAPSULATE CONCEPTS OF LEXICAL AND CLINICAL SYNONYMY AND ANTONYMY AND TO A SMALLER EXTENT, HYPONYMY AND HYPERNYMY. BIO + CLINICAL BERT VECTORS PERFORM BETTER AT NER AND AVOID OUT-OF-VOCABULARY WORDS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
THE SCALABLE FUZZY INFERENCE-BASED ENSEMBLE METHOD FOR SENTIMENT ANALYSIS. INTERNET ENVIRONMENTS SUCH AS SOCIAL NETWORKS, NEWS SITES, AND BLOGS ARE THE PLATFORMS WHERE PEOPLE CAN SHARE THEIR IDEAS AND OPINIONS. MANY PEOPLE SHARE THEIR COMMENTS INSTANTLY ON THE INTERNET, WHICH RESULTS IN CREATING LARGE VOLUMES OF ENTRIES. IT IS IMPORTANT FOR INSTITUTIONS AND ORGANIZATIONS TO ANALYZE THIS BIG DATA IN AN EFFICIENT AND RAPID MANNER TO PRODUCE SUMMARY INFORMATION ABOUT THE FEELINGS OR OPINIONS OF INDIVIDUALS. IN THIS STUDY, WE PROPOSE A SCALABLE FRAMEWORK THAT MAKES SENTIMENT CLASSIFICATION BY EVALUATING THE COMPOUND PROBABILITY SCORES OF THE MOST WIDELY USED METHODS IN SENTIMENT ANALYSIS THROUGH A FUZZY INFERENCE MECHANISM IN AN ENSEMBLE MANNER. THE DESIGNED FUZZY INFERENCE SYSTEM MAKES THE SENTIMENT ESTIMATION BY EVALUATING THE COMPOUND SCORES OF VALANCE AWARE DICTIONARY, WORD EMBEDDING, AND COUNT VECTORIZATION PROCESSES. THE DIFFERENCE OF THE PROPOSED METHOD FROM THE CLASSICAL ENSEMBLE METHODS IS THAT IT ALLOWS WEIGHTING OF BASE LEARNERS AND COMBINES THE STRENGTHS OF EACH ALGORITHM THROUGH FUZZY RULES. THE SENTIMENT ESTIMATION PROCESS FROM TEXT DATA CAN BE MANAGED EITHER AS A 2-CLASS (POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE) OR AS A 3-CLASS (POSITIVE, NEUTRAL, AND NEGATIVE) PROBLEM. WE PERFORMED THE EXPERIMENTAL WORK ON FOUR AVAILABLE TAGGED SOCIAL NETWORK DATA SETS FOR BOTH 2-CLASS AND 3-CLASS CLASSIFICATIONS AND OBSERVED THAT THE PROPOSED METHOD PROVIDES IMPROVEMENTS IN ACCURACY.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
THE SPECTRAL UNDERPINNING OF WORD2VEC. WORD2VEC INTRODUCED BY MIKOLOV ET AL. IS A WORD EMBEDDING METHOD THAT IS WIDELY USED IN NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING. DESPITE ITS SUCCESS AND FREQUENT USE, A STRONG THEORETICAL JUSTIFICATION IS STILL LACKING. THE MAIN CONTRIBUTION OF OUR PAPER IS TO PROPOSE A RIGOROUS ANALYSIS OF THE HIGHLY NONLINEAR FUNCTIONAL OF WORD2VEC. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT WORD2VEC MAY BE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY AN UNDERLYING SPECTRAL METHOD. THIS INSIGHT MAY OPEN THE DOOR TO OBTAINING PROVABLE GUARANTEES FOR WORD2VEC. WE SUPPORT THESE FINDINGS BY NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS. ONE FASCINATING OPEN QUESTION IS WHETHER THE NONLINEAR PROPERTIES OF WORD2VEC THAT ARE NOT CAPTURED BY THE SPECTRAL METHOD ARE BENEFICIAL AND, IF SO, BY WHAT MECHANISM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
THESAURUS-BASED WORD EMBEDDINGS FOR AUTOMATED BIOMEDICAL LITERATURE CLASSIFICATION. THE SPECIAL NATURE, VOLUME AND BROADNESS OF BIOMEDICAL LITERATURE POSE BARRIERS FOR AUTOMATED CLASSIFICATION METHODS. ON THE OTHER HAND, MANUALLY INDEXING IS TIME-CONSUMING, COSTLY AND ERROR PRONE. WE ARGUE THAT CURRENT WORD EMBEDDING ALGORITHMS CAN BE EFFICIENTLY USED TO SUPPORT THE TASK OF BIOMEDICAL TEXT CLASSIFICATION EVEN IN A MULTILABEL SETTING, WITH MANY DISTINCT LABELS. THE ONTOLOGY REPRESENTATION OF MEDICAL SUBJECT HEADINGS PROVIDES MACHINE-READABLE LABELS AND SPECIFIES THE DIMENSIONALITY OF THE PROBLEM SPACE. BOTH DEEP- AND SHALLOW NETWORK APPROACHES ARE IMPLEMENTED. PREDICTIONS ARE DETERMINED BY THE SIMILARITY BETWEEN EXTRACTED FEATURES FROM CONTEXTUALIZED REPRESENTATIONS OF ABSTRACTS AND HEADINGS. THE ADDITION OF A SEPARATE CLASSIFIER FOR TRANSFER LEARNING IS ALSO PROPOSED AND EVALUATED. LARGE DATASETS OF BIOMEDICAL CITATIONS ARE HARVESTED FOR THEIR METADATA AND USED FOR TRAINING AND TESTING. THESE AUTOMATED APPROACHES ARE STILL FAR FROM ENTIRELY SUBSTITUTING HUMAN EXPERTS, YET THEY CAN BE USEFUL AS A MECHANISM FOR VALIDATION AND RECOMMENDATION. DATASET BALANCING, DISTRIBUTED PROCESSING AND TRAINING PARALLELIZATION IN GPUS, ALL PLAY AN IMPORTANT PART REGARDING THE EFFECTIVENESS AND PERFORMANCE OF PROPOSED METHODS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
TNFPRED: IDENTIFYING TUMOR NECROSIS FACTORS USING HYBRID FEATURES BASED ON WORD EMBEDDINGS. BACKGROUND: CYTOKINES ARE A CLASS OF SMALL PROTEINS THAT ACT AS CHEMICAL MESSENGERS AND PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN ESSENTIAL CELLULAR PROCESSES INCLUDING IMMUNITY REGULATION, HEMATOPOIESIS, AND INFLAMMATION. AS ONE IMPORTANT FAMILY OF CYTOKINES, TUMOR NECROSIS FACTORS HAVE ASSOCIATION WITH THE REGULATION OF A VARIOUS BIOLOGICAL PROCESSES SUCH AS PROLIFERATION AND DIFFERENTIATION OF CELLS, APOPTOSIS, LIPID METABOLISM, AND COAGULATION. THE IMPLICATION OF THESE CYTOKINES CAN ALSO BE SEEN IN VARIOUS DISEASES SUCH AS INSULIN RESISTANCE, AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES, AND CANCER. CONSIDERING THE INTERDEPENDENCE BETWEEN THIS KIND OF CYTOKINE AND OTHERS, CLASSIFYING TUMOR NECROSIS FACTORS FROM OTHER CYTOKINES IS A CHALLENGE FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENTISTS. METHODS: IN THIS RESEARCH, WE EMPLOYED A WORD EMBEDDING TECHNIQUE TO CREATE HYBRID FEATURES WHICH WAS PROVED TO EFFICIENTLY IDENTIFY TUMOR NECROSIS FACTORS GIVEN CYTOKINE SEQUENCES. WE SEGMENTED EACH PROTEIN SEQUENCE INTO PROTEIN WORDS AND CREATED CORRESPONDING WORD EMBEDDING FOR EACH WORD. THEN, WORD EMBEDDING-BASED VECTOR FOR EACH SEQUENCE WAS CREATED AND INPUT INTO MACHINE LEARNING CLASSIFICATION MODELS. WHEN EXTRACTING FEATURE SETS, WE NOT ONLY DIVERSIFIED SEGMENTATION SIZES OF PROTEIN SEQUENCE BUT ALSO CONDUCTED DIFFERENT COMBINATIONS AMONG SPLIT GRAMS TO FIND THE BEST FEATURES WHICH GENERATED THE OPTIMAL PREDICTION. FURTHERMORE, OUR METHODOLOGY FOLLOWS A WELL-DEFINED PROCEDURE TO BUILD A RELIABLE CLASSIFICATION TOOL. RESULTS: WITH OUR PROPOSED HYBRID FEATURES, PREDICTION MODELS OBTAIN MORE PROMISING PERFORMANCE COMPARED TO SEVEN PROMINENT SEQUENCED-BASED FEATURE KINDS. RESULTS FROM 10 INDEPENDENT RUNS ON THE SURVEYED DATASET SHOW THAT ON AN AVERAGE, OUR OPTIMAL MODELS OBTAIN AN AREA UNDER THE CURVE OF 0.984 AND 0.998 ON 5-FOLD CROSS-VALIDATION AND INDEPENDENT TEST, RESPECTIVELY. CONCLUSIONS: THESE RESULTS SHOW THAT BIOLOGISTS CAN USE OUR MODEL TO IDENTIFY TUMOR NECROSIS FACTORS FROM OTHER CYTOKINES EFFICIENTLY. MOREOVER, THIS STUDY PROVES THAT NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING TECHNIQUES CAN BE APPLIED REASONABLY TO HELP BIOLOGISTS SOLVE BIOINFORMATICS PROBLEMS EFFICIENTLY.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
TRAFFIC ACCIDENT DETECTION AND CONDITION ANALYSIS BASED ON SOCIAL NETWORKING DATA. ACCURATE DETECTION OF TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS AS WELL AS CONDITION ANALYSIS ARE ESSENTIAL TO EFFECTIVELY RESTORING TRAFFIC FLOW AND REDUCING SERIOUS INJURIES AND FATALITIES. THIS GOAL CAN BE OBTAINED USING AN ADVANCED DATA CLASSIFICATION MODEL WITH A RICH SOURCE OF TRAFFIC INFORMATION. SEVERAL SYSTEMS BASED ON SENSORS AND SOCIAL NETWORKING PLATFORMS HAVE BEEN PRESENTED RECENTLY TO DETECT TRAFFIC EVENTS AND MONITOR TRAFFIC CONDITIONS. HOWEVER, SENSOR-BASED SYSTEMS PROVIDE LIMITED INFORMATION, AND MAY FAIL OWING TO THE LONG DETECTION TIMES AND HIGH FALSE-ALARM RATES. IN ADDITION, SOCIAL NETWORKING DATA ARE UNSTRUCTURED, UNPREDICTABLE, AND CONTAIN IDIOMS, JARGON, AND DYNAMIC TOPICS. THE MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS UTILIZED FOR TRAFFIC EVENT DETECTION MIGHT NOT EXTRACT VALUABLE INFORMATION FROM SOCIAL NETWORKING DATA. IN THIS PAPER, A SOCIAL NETWORK-BASED, REAL-TIME MONITORING FRAMEWORK IS PROPOSED FOR TRAFFIC ACCIDENT DETECTION AND CONDITION ANALYSIS USING ONTOLOGY AND LATENT DIRICHLET ALLOCATION (OLDA) AND BIDIRECTIONAL LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY (BI-LSTM). FIRST, THE QUERY-BASED SEARCH ENGINE EFFECTIVELY COLLECTS TRAFFIC INFORMATION FROM SOCIAL NETWORKS, AND THE DATA PREPROCESSING MODULE TRANSFORMS IT INTO STRUCTURED FORM. SECOND, THE PROPOSED OLDA-BASED TOPIC MODELING METHOD AUTOMATICALLY LABELS EACH SENTENCE (E.G., TRAFFIC OR NON-TRAFFIC) TO IDENTIFY THE EXACT TRAFFIC INFORMATION. IN ADDITION, THE ONTOLOGY-BASED EVENT RECOGNITION APPROACH DETECTS TRAFFIC EVENTS FROM TRAFFIC-RELATED DATA. NEXT, THE SENTIMENT ANALYSIS TECHNIQUE IDENTIFIES THE POLARITY OF TRAFFIC EVENTS EMPLOYING USER'S OPINIONS, WHICH HELPS DETERMINE ACCURATE CONDITIONS OF TRAFFIC EVENTS. FINALLY, THE FASTTEXT MODEL AND BI-LSTM WITH SOFTMAX REGRESSION ARE TRAINED FOR TRAFFIC EVENT DETECTION AND CONDITION ANALYSIS. THE PROPOSED FRAMEWORK IS EVALUATED USING TRAFFIC-RELATED DATA, COMPARING OLDA AND BI-LSTM WITH EXISTING TOPIC MODELING METHODS AND TRADITIONAL CLASSIFIERS USING WORD EMBEDDING MODELS, RESPECTIVELY. OUR SYSTEM OUTPERFORMS STATE-OF-THE-ART METHODS AND ACHIEVES ACCURACY OF 97 %. THIS FINDING DEMONSTRATES THAT THE PROPOSED SYSTEM IS MORE EFFICIENT FOR TRAFFIC EVENT DETECTION AND CONDITION ANALYSIS, IN COMPARISON TO OTHER EXISTING SYSTEMS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
TRANSFER LEARNING FOR SENTIMENT ANALYSIS USING BERT BASED SUPERVISED FINE-TUNING. THE GROWTH OF THE INTERNET HAS EXPANDED THE AMOUNT OF DATA EXPRESSED BY USERS ACROSS MULTIPLE PLATFORMS. THE AVAILABILITY OF THESE DIFFERENT WORLDVIEWS AND INDIVIDUALS' EMOTIONS EMPOWERS SENTIMENT ANALYSIS. HOWEVER, SENTIMENT ANALYSIS BECOMES EVEN MORE CHALLENGING DUE TO A SCARCITY OF STANDARDIZED LABELED DATA IN THE BANGLA NLP DOMAIN. THE MAJORITY OF THE EXISTING BANGLA RESEARCH HAS RELIED ON MODELS OF DEEP LEARNING THAT SIGNIFICANTLY FOCUS ON CONTEXT-INDEPENDENT WORD EMBEDDINGS, SUCH AS WORD2VEC, GLOVE, AND FASTTEXT, IN WHICH EACH WORD HAS A FIXED REPRESENTATION IRRESPECTIVE OF ITS CONTEXT. MEANWHILE, CONTEXT-BASED PRE-TRAINED LANGUAGE MODELS SUCH AS BERT HAVE RECENTLY REVOLUTIONIZED THE STATE OF NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING. IN THIS WORK, WE UTILIZED BERT'S TRANSFER LEARNING ABILITY TO A DEEP INTEGRATED MODEL CNN-BILSTM FOR ENHANCED PERFORMANCE OF DECISION-MAKING IN SENTIMENT ANALYSIS. IN ADDITION, WE ALSO INTRODUCED THE ABILITY OF TRANSFER LEARNING TO CLASSICAL MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS FOR THE PERFORMANCE COMPARISON OF CNN-BILSTM. ADDITIONALLY, WE EXPLORE VARIOUS WORD EMBEDDING TECHNIQUES, SUCH AS WORD2VEC, GLOVE, AND FASTTEXT, AND COMPARE THEIR PERFORMANCE TO THE BERT TRANSFER LEARNING STRATEGY. AS A RESULT, WE HAVE SHOWN A STATE-OF-THE-ART BINARY CLASSIFICATION PERFORMANCE FOR BANGLA SENTIMENT ANALYSIS THAT SIGNIFICANTLY OUTPERFORMS ALL EMBEDDING AND ALGORITHMS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
TRANSLATING MEDICAL IMAGE TO RADIOLOGICAL REPORT: ADAPTIVE MULTILEVEL MULTI-ATTENTION APPROACH. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: MEDICAL IMAGING TECHNIQUES ARE WIDELY EMPLOYED IN DISEASE DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT. A READILY AVAILABLE MEDICAL REPORT CAN BE A USEFUL TOOL IN ASSISTING AN EXPERT FOR INVESTIGATING THE PATIENT'S HEALTH. A RADIOLOGIST CAN BENEFIT FROM AN AUTOMATIC MEDICAL IMAGE TO RADIOLOGICAL REPORT TRANSLATION SYSTEM WHILE PREPARING A FINAL REPORT. PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS ON AUTOMATIC MEDICAL REPORT GENERATION TASK INCLUDES IMAGE CAPTIONING ALGORITHMS WITHOUT TAKING DOMAIN-SPECIFIC VISUAL AND TEXTUAL CONTENTS INTO ACCOUNT, THUS ARISES THE QUESTION ABOUT CREDIBILITY OF GENERATED REPORT. METHODS: IN THIS WORK, A NOVEL ADAPTIVE MULTILEVEL MULTI-ATTENTION (AMLMA) APPROACH IS PROPOSED BY OFFERING DOMAIN-SPECIFIC VISUAL-TEXTUAL KNOWLEDGE TO GENERATE A THOROUGH AND BELIEVABLE RADIOLOGICAL REPORT FOR ANY VIEW OF A HUMAN CHEST X-RAY IMAGE. THE PROPOSED APPROACH LEVERAGES THE ENCODER-DECODER FRAMEWORK INCORPORATED WITH MULTIPLE ADAPTIVE ATTENTION MECHANISMS. THE POTENTIAL OF A CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (CNN) WITH RESIDUAL ATTENTION MODULE (RAM) IS DEMONSTRATED AS A STRONG VISUAL ENCODER FOR MULTI-LABEL ABNORMALITY DETECTION. THE MULTILEVEL VISUAL FEATURES (LOCAL AND GLOBAL) ARE EXTRACTED FROM PROPOSED VISUAL ENCODER TO RETRIEVE REGIONAL-LEVEL AND ABSTRACT-LEVEL RADIOLOGY-BASED SEMANTIC INFORMATION. THE WORD2VEC AND FASTTEXT WORD EMBEDDINGS ARE TRAINED ON MEDICAL REPORTS TO ACQUIRE RADIOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE AND FURTHER USED AS TEXTUAL ENCODERS, FEEDING AS INPUT TO BI-DIRECTIONAL LONG SHORT TERM MEMORY (BI-LSTM) NETWORK TO LEARN THE CO-RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MEDICAL TERMINOLOGIES IN RADIOLOGICAL REPORTS. THE AMLMA EMPLOYS A WEIGHTED MULTILEVEL ASSOCIATION OF ADAPTIVE VISUAL-SEMANTIC ATTENTION AND VISUAL-BASED LINGUISTIC ATTENTION MECHANISMS. THIS ASSOCIATION OF ADAPTIVE ATTENTION IS EXPLOITED AS A DECODER AND PRODUCES SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN THE REPORT GENERATION TASK. RESULTS: THE PROPOSED APPROACH IS EVALUATED ON A PUBLICLY AVAILABLE INDIANA UNIVERSITY CHEST X-RAY (IU-CXR) DATASET. THE CNN WITH RAM SHOWS THE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN RECALL (0.4423), PRECISION (0.1803) AND F1-SCORE (0.2551) FOR PREDICTION OF MULTIPLE ABNORMALITIES IN X-RAY IMAGE. THE RESULTS OF LANGUAGE GENERATION METRICS FOR PROPOSED VARIANTS WERE ACQUIRED USING THE COCO-CAPTION EVALUATION APPLICATION PROGRAM INTERFACE (API). THE TRAINED EMBEDDINGS WITH AMLMA MODEL GENERATES THE CONVINCING RADIOLOGY REPORT AND OUTPERFORM STATE-OF-THE-ART (SOTA) APPROACHES WITH HIGH EVALUATION METRICS SCORES FOR BLEU-4 (0.172), METEOR (0.247), ROUGE_L (0.376) AND CIDER (0.381). IN ADDITION, A NEW "UNIQUE INDEX" (UI) STATISTIC IS INTRODUCED TO HIGHLIGHT THE MODEL'S ABILITY FOR GENERATING UNIQUE REPORTS. CONCLUSION: THE OVERALL ARCHITECTURE AIDS TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF VARIOUS X-RAY IMAGE VIEWS AND GENERATING THE RELEVANT NORMAL AND ABNORMAL RADIOGRAPHY STATEMENTS. THE PROPOSED MODEL IS EMPHASIZED ON MULTI-LEVEL VISUAL-TEXTUAL KNOWLEDGE WITH ADAPTIVE ATTENTION MECHANISM TO BALANCE VISUAL AND LINGUISTIC INFORMATION FOR THE GENERATION OF ADMISSIBLE RADIOLOGY REPORT.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
TRIAGE OF DOCUMENTS CONTAINING PROTEIN INTERACTIONS AFFECTED BY MUTATIONS USING AN NLP BASED MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH. BACKGROUND: INFORMATION ON PROTEIN-PROTEIN INTERACTIONS AFFECTED BY MUTATIONS IS VERY USEFUL FOR UNDERSTANDING THE BIOLOGICAL EFFECT OF MUTATIONS AND FOR DEVELOPING TREATMENTS TARGETING THE INTERACTIONS. IN THIS STUDY, WE DEVELOPED A NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) BASED MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH FOR EXTRACTING SUCH INFORMATION FROM LITERATURE. OUR AIM IS TO IDENTIFY JOURNAL ABSTRACTS OR PARAGRAPHS IN FULL-TEXT ARTICLES THAT CONTAIN AT LEAST ONE OCCURRENCE OF A PROTEIN-PROTEIN INTERACTION (PPI) AFFECTED BY A MUTATION. RESULTS: OUR SYSTEM MAKES USE OF LATEST NLP METHODS WITH A LARGE NUMBER OF ENGINEERED FEATURES INCLUDING SOME BASED ON PRE-TRAINED WORD EMBEDDING. OUR FINAL MODEL ACHIEVED SATISFACTORY PERFORMANCE IN THE DOCUMENT TRIAGE TASK OF THE BIOCREATIVE VI PRECISION MEDICINE TRACK WITH HIGHEST RECALL AND COMPARABLE F1-SCORE. CONCLUSIONS: THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR METHOD INDICATES THAT IT IS IDEALLY SUITED FOR BEING COMBINED WITH MANUAL ANNOTATIONS. OUR MACHINE LEARNING FRAMEWORK AND ENGINEERED FEATURES WILL ALSO BE VERY HELPFUL FOR OTHER RESEARCHERS TO FURTHER IMPROVE THIS AND OTHER RELATED BIOLOGICAL TEXT MINING TASKS USING EITHER TRADITIONAL MACHINE LEARNING OR DEEP LEARNING BASED METHODS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
TRP-BERT: DISCRIMINATION OF TRANSIENT RECEPTOR POTENTIAL (TRP) CHANNELS USING CONTEXTUAL REPRESENTATIONS FROM DEEP BIDIRECTIONAL TRANSFORMER BASED ON BERT. TRANSIENT RECEPTOR POTENTIAL (TRP) CHANNELS ARE NON-SELECTIVE CATION CHANNELS THAT ACT AS ION CHANNELS AND ARE PRIMARILY FOUND ON THE PLASMA MEMBRANE OF NUMEROUS ANIMAL CELLS. THESE CHANNELS ARE INVOLVED IN THE PHYSIOLOGY AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF A WIDE VARIETY OF BIOLOGICAL PROCESSES, INCLUDING INHIBITION AND PROGRESSION OF CANCER, PAIN INITIATION, INFLAMMATION, REGULATION OF PRESSURE, THERMOREGULATION, SECRETION OF SALIVARY FLUID, AND HOMEOSTASIS OF CA(2+) AND MG(2+). INCREASING EVIDENCES INDICATE THAT MUTATIONS IN THE GENE ENCODING TRP CHANNELS PLAY AN ESSENTIAL ROLE IN A BROAD ARRAY OF DISEASES. THEREFORE, THESE CHANNELS ARE BECOMING POPULAR AS POTENTIAL DRUG TARGETS FOR SEVERAL DISEASES. THE DIVERSIFIED ROLE OF THESE CHANNELS DEMANDS A PREDICTION MODEL TO CLASSIFY TRP CHANNELS FROM OTHER CHANNEL PROTEINS (NON-TRP CHANNELS). THEREFORE, WE PRESENTED AN APPROACH BASED ON THE SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE (SVM) CLASSIFIER AND CONTEXTUALIZED WORD EMBEDDINGS FROM BIDIRECTIONAL ENCODER REPRESENTATIONS FROM TRANSFORMERS (BERT) TO REPRESENT PROTEIN SEQUENCES. BERT IS A DEEPLY BIDIRECTIONAL LANGUAGE MODEL AND A NEURAL NETWORK APPROACH TO NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) THAT ACHIEVES OUTSTANDING PERFORMANCE ON VARIOUS NLP TASKS. WE APPLY BERT TO GENERATE CONTEXTUALIZED REPRESENTATIONS FOR EVERY SINGLE AMINO ACID IN A PROTEIN SEQUENCE. INTERESTINGLY, THESE REPRESENTATIONS ARE CONTEXT-SENSITIVE AND VARY FOR THE SAME AMINO ACID APPEARING IN DIFFERENT POSITIONS IN THE SEQUENCE. OUR PROPOSED METHOD SHOWED 80.00% SENSITIVITY, 96.03% SPECIFICITY, 95.47% ACCURACY, AND A 0.56 MATTHEWS CORRELATION COEFFICIENT (MCC) FOR AN INDEPENDENT TEST SET. WE SUGGEST THAT OUR PROPOSED METHOD COULD EFFECTIVELY CLASSIFY TRP CHANNELS FROM NON-TRP CHANNELS AND ASSIST BIOLOGISTS IN IDENTIFYING NEW POTENTIAL TRP CHANNELS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
UMLS MAPPING AND WORD EMBEDDINGS FOR ICD CODE ASSIGNMENT USING THE MIMIC-III INTENSIVE CARE DATABASE. DIAGNOSIS CODES ARE USED AS A BILLING MECHANISM IN THE ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD AND HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO BENEFIT DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS, WHICH AIM TO ASSIST CODERS BY SUGGESTING A RELEVANT SUBSET OF POTENTIAL CODES TO CHOOSE FROM. DUE TO THE LARGE SET OF POSSIBLE LABELS AND LENGTH OF PATIENT RECORDS, AUTOMATIC ICD CODE ASSIGNMENT IS CONSIDERED TO BE A CHALLENGING TASK WITHIN THE FIELD OF MULTI-LABEL CLASSIFICATION. THIS PAPER INTRODUCES A BASELINE FOR AUTOMATIC ICD CODE ASSIGNMENT USING SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES (SVM) AND FASTTEXT WITH UNIFIED MEDICAL LANGUAGE SYSTEM (UMLS) METATHESAURUS MAPPINGS INTO WORD EMBEDDING MODELS. TRAINING DATA IS OBTAINED FROM THE MEDICAL INFORMATION MART FOR INTENSIVE CARE (MIMIC-III) DATABASE AND EXTENDED WITH 'IS-A' RELATIONSHIPS FROM ICD-9 HIERARCHY.

UNDERSTANDING THE SPATIAL DIMENSION OF NATURAL LANGUAGE BY MEASURING THE SPATIAL SEMANTIC SIMILARITY OF WORDS THROUGH A SCALABLE GEOSPATIAL CONTEXT WINDOW. MEASURING THE SEMANTIC SIMILARITY BETWEEN WORDS IS IMPORTANT FOR NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING TASKS. THE TRADITIONAL MODELS OF SEMANTIC SIMILARITY PERFORM WELL IN MOST CASES, BUT WHEN DEALING WITH WORDS THAT INVOLVE GEOGRAPHICAL CONTEXT, SPATIAL SEMANTICS OF IMPLIED SPATIAL INFORMATION ARE RARELY PRESERVED. GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION RETRIEVAL (GIR) METHODS HAVE FOCUSED ON THIS ISSUE; HOWEVER, THEY SOMETIMES FAIL TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM BECAUSE THE SPATIAL AND TEXTUAL SIMILARITIES OF WORDS ARE CONSIDERED AND CALCULATED SEPARATELY. IN THIS PAPER, FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF SPATIAL CONTEXT, WE CONSIDER THE TWO PARTS AS A WHOLE-SPATIAL CONTEXT SEMANTICS, AND WE PROPOSE A METHOD THAT MEASURES SPATIAL SEMANTIC SIMILARITY USING A SLIDING GEOSPATIAL CONTEXT WINDOW FOR GEO-TAGGED WORDS. THE PROPOSED METHOD WAS FIRST VALIDATED WITH A SET OF SIMULATED DATA AND THEN APPLIED TO A REAL-WORLD DATASET FROM FLICKR. AS A RESULT, A SPATIAL SEMANTIC SIMILARITY MODEL AT DIFFERENT SCALES IS PRESENTED. WE BELIEVE THIS MODEL IS A NECESSARY SUPPLEMENT FOR TRADITIONAL TEXTUAL-LANGUAGE SEMANTIC ANALYSES OF WORDS OBTAINED BY WORD-EMBEDDING TECHNOLOGIES. THIS STUDY HAS THE POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF RECOMMENDATION SYSTEMS BY CONSIDERING RELEVANT SPATIAL CONTEXT SEMANTICS, AND BENEFITS LINGUISTIC SEMANTIC RESEARCH BY EMPHASISING THE SPATIAL COGNITION AMONG WORDS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
UNDERSTANDING WHAT PATIENTS THINK ABOUT HOSPITALS: A DEEP LEARNING APPROACH FOR DETECTING EMOTIONS IN PATIENT OPINIONS. INTRODUCTION: MOST HOSPITAL ASSESSMENT SYSTEMS ARE BASED ON THE STUDY OF OBJECTIVE STATISTICAL VARIABLES AS WELL AS PATIENT OPINIONS ON THEIR EXPERIENCES WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICES OFFERED BY EACH HOSPITAL. NEVERTHELESS, STUDIES HAVE INDICATED THAT MOST OF THESE ASSESSMENT SYSTEMS FAIL TO DETECT PATIENT EMOTIONS WHEN THEY ARE ASSESSING THEIR STAYS IN A HOSPITAL. THIS INFORMATION IS VITAL TO UNDERSTANDING MOST OF THE PATIENT REVIEWS, WHICH ARE VERY COMPLEX AND CONVEY SEVERAL EMOTIONS PER REVIEW. THEREFORE, THIS STUDY AIMED TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OF DETECTING MULTIPLE EMOTIONS FROM PATIENT REVIEWS. METHODS: FIRST, A LARGE SET OF PATIENT OPINIONS WAS COLLECTED FROM A WEBSITE THAT ALLOWED PATIENTS TO PUBLISH THEIR EXPERIENCES WHEN VISITING HOSPITALS. SECOND, EACH OPINION WAS LABELED WITH THE CORRESPONDING CONVEYED EMOTIONS. THIRD, A DEEP LEARNING ARCHITECTURE BASED ON A BIDIRECTIONAL GATED RECURRENT UNIT WITH A MULTICHANNEL CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK LAYER WAS PROPOSED TO DETECT MULTIPLE EMOTIONS FROM THESE REVIEWS. FINALLY, THE HYPERPARAMETERS OF THIS ARCHITECTURE WERE FINE-TUNED AND DIFFERENT PRETRAINED WORD EMBEDDING MODELS WERE CONFIGURED TO TEST ITS PERFORMANCE. RESULTS: THE RESULTS CONFIRMED THAT OUR PROPOSED METHOD OUTPERFORMED OTHER DEEP LEARNING AND MACHINE LEARNING-BASED ALGORITHMS AND ACHIEVED AN AVERAGE ACCURACY OF 95.82%. FURTHERMORE, THE EXPERIMENTS SHOW THAT CLINICAL-DOMAIN WORD EMBEDDING SLIGHTLY OUTPERFORMS OTHER GENERAL-DOMAIN WORD EMBEDDINGS, ALTHOUGH GENERAL-DOMAIN EMBEDDINGS ARE LARGER IN TERMS OF DIMENSIONS. CONCLUSIONS: THE COMBINATION OF THE GATED RECURRENT UNIT AND THE MULTICHANNEL CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK IS ABLE TO EXPLOIT BOTH SEMANTIC AND SYNTACTIC CHARACTERISTICS OF PATIENT OPINIONS. THE FINDINGS OF THIS STUDY IDENTIFY RESEARCH GAPS RELATED TO AREAS SUCH AS OPINION-BASED HOSPITAL RECOMMENDATIONS, THEREBY PROVIDING FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
UNSUPERVISED WORD EMBEDDING LEARNING BY INCORPORATING LOCAL AND GLOBAL CONTEXTS. WORD EMBEDDING HAS BENEFITED A BROAD SPECTRUM OF TEXT ANALYSIS TASKS BY LEARNING DISTRIBUTED WORD REPRESENTATIONS TO ENCODE WORD SEMANTICS. WORD REPRESENTATIONS ARE TYPICALLY LEARNED BY MODELING LOCAL CONTEXTS OF WORDS, ASSUMING THAT WORDS SHARING SIMILAR SURROUNDING WORDS ARE SEMANTICALLY CLOSE. WE ARGUE THAT LOCAL CONTEXTS CAN ONLY PARTIALLY DEFINE WORD SEMANTICS IN THE UNSUPERVISED WORD EMBEDDING LEARNING. GLOBAL CONTEXTS, REFERRING TO THE BROADER SEMANTIC UNITS, SUCH AS THE DOCUMENT OR PARAGRAPH WHERE THE WORD APPEARS, CAN CAPTURE DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF WORD SEMANTICS AND COMPLEMENT LOCAL CONTEXTS. WE PROPOSE TWO SIMPLE YET EFFECTIVE UNSUPERVISED WORD EMBEDDING MODELS THAT JOINTLY MODEL BOTH LOCAL AND GLOBAL CONTEXTS TO LEARN WORD REPRESENTATIONS. WE PROVIDE THEORETICAL INTERPRETATIONS OF THE PROPOSED MODELS TO DEMONSTRATE HOW LOCAL AND GLOBAL CONTEXTS ARE JOINTLY MODELED, ASSUMING A GENERATIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN WORDS AND CONTEXTS. WE CONDUCT A THOROUGH EVALUATION ON A WIDE RANGE OF BENCHMARK DATASETS. OUR QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS AND CASE STUDY SHOW THAT DESPITE THEIR SIMPLICITY, OUR TWO PROPOSED MODELS ACHIEVE SUPERIOR PERFORMANCE ON WORD SIMILARITY AND TEXT CLASSIFICATION TASKS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
USE CHOU'S 5-STEPS RULE WITH DIFFERENT WORD EMBEDDING TYPES TO BOOST PERFORMANCE OF ELECTRON TRANSPORT PROTEIN PREDICTION MODEL. LIVING ORGANISMS RECEIVE NECESSARY ENERGY SUBSTANCES DIRECTLY FROM CELLULAR RESPIRATION. THE COMPLETION OF ELECTRON STORAGE AND TRANSPORTATION REQUIRES THE PROCESS OF CELLULAR RESPIRATION WITH THE AID OF ELECTRON TRANSPORT CHAINS. THEREFORE, THE WORK OF DECIPHERING ELECTRON TRANSPORT PROTEINS IS INEVITABLY NEEDED. THE IDENTIFICATION OF THESE PROTEINS WITH HIGH PERFORMANCE HAS A PROMPT DEPENDENCE ON THE CHOICE OF METHODS FOR FEATURE EXTRACTION AND MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHM. IN THIS STUDY, PROTEIN SEQUENCES SERVED AS NATURAL LANGUAGE SENTENCES COMPRISING WORDS. THE NOMINATED WORD EMBEDDING-BASED FEATURE SETS, HINGED ON THE WORD EMBEDDING MODULATION AND PROTEIN MOTIF FREQUENCIES, WERE USEFUL FOR FEATURE CHOOSING. FIVE WORD EMBEDDING TYPES AND A VARIETY OF CONJOINT FEATURES WERE EXAMINED FOR SUCH FEATURE SELECTION. THE SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE ALGORITHM CONSEQUENTIALLY WAS EMPLOYED TO PERFORM CLASSIFICATION. THE PERFORMANCE STATISTICS WITHIN THE 5-FOLD CROSS-VALIDATION INCLUDING AVERAGE ACCURACY, SPECIFICITY, SENSITIVITY, AS WELL AS MCC RATES SURPASS 0.95. SUCH METRICS IN THE INDEPENDENT TEST ARE 96.82, 97.16, 95.76 PERCENT, AND 0.9, RESPECTIVELY. COMPARED TO STATE-OF-THE-ART PREDICTORS, THE PROPOSED METHOD CAN GENERATE MORE PREFERABLE PERFORMANCE ABOVE ALL METRICS INDICATING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROPOSED METHOD IN DETERMINING ELECTRON TRANSPORT PROTEINS. FURTHERMORE, THIS STUDY REVEALS INSIGHTS ABOUT THE APPLICABILITY OF VARIOUS WORD EMBEDDINGS FOR UNDERSTANDING SURVEYED SEQUENCES.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
USE OF WORD AND GRAPH EMBEDDING TO MEASURE SEMANTIC RELATEDNESS BETWEEN UNIFIED MEDICAL LANGUAGE SYSTEM CONCEPTS. OBJECTIVE: THE STUDY SOUGHT TO EXPLORE THE USE OF DEEP LEARNING TECHNIQUES TO MEASURE THE SEMANTIC RELATEDNESS BETWEEN UNIFIED MEDICAL LANGUAGE SYSTEM (UMLS) CONCEPTS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: CONCEPT SENTENCE EMBEDDINGS WERE GENERATED FOR UMLS CONCEPTS BY APPLYING THE WORD EMBEDDING MODELS BIOWORDVEC AND VARIOUS FLAVORS OF BERT TO CONCEPT SENTENCES FORMED BY CONCATENATING UMLS TERMS. GRAPH EMBEDDINGS WERE GENERATED BY THE GRAPH CONVOLUTIONAL NETWORKS AND 4 KNOWLEDGE GRAPH EMBEDDING MODELS, USING GRAPHS BUILT FROM UMLS HIERARCHICAL RELATIONS. SEMANTIC RELATEDNESS WAS MEASURED BY THE COSINE BETWEEN THE CONCEPTS' EMBEDDING VECTORS. PERFORMANCE WAS COMPARED WITH 2 TRADITIONAL PATH-BASED (SHORTEST PATH AND LEACOCK-CHODOROW) MEASUREMENTS AND THE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE CONCEPT EMBEDDINGS, CUI2VEC, GENERATED FROM LARGE BIOMEDICAL CORPORA. THE CONCEPT SENTENCE EMBEDDINGS WERE ALSO EVALUATED ON A WORD SENSE DISAMBIGUATION (WSD) TASK. REFERENCE STANDARDS USED INCLUDED THE SEMANTIC RELATEDNESS AND SEMANTIC SIMILARITY DATASETS FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA, CONCEPT PAIRS GENERATED FROM THE STANDARDIZED MEDDRA QUERIES AND THE MESH (MEDICAL SUBJECT HEADINGS) WSD CORPUS. RESULTS: SENTENCE EMBEDDINGS GENERATED BY BIOWORDVEC OUTPERFORMED ALL OTHER METHODS USED INDIVIDUALLY IN SEMANTIC RELATEDNESS MEASUREMENTS. GRAPH CONVOLUTIONAL NETWORK GRAPH EMBEDDING UNIFORMLY OUTPERFORMED PATH-BASED MEASUREMENTS AND WAS BETTER THAN SOME WORD EMBEDDINGS FOR THE STANDARDIZED MEDDRA QUERIES DATASET. WHEN USED TOGETHER, COMBINED WORD AND GRAPH EMBEDDING ACHIEVED THE BEST PERFORMANCE IN ALL DATASETS. FOR WSD, THE ENHANCED VERSIONS OF BERT OUTPERFORMED BIOWORDVEC. CONCLUSIONS: WORD AND GRAPH EMBEDDING TECHNIQUES CAN BE USED TO HARNESS TERMS AND RELATIONS IN THE UMLS TO MEASURE SEMANTIC RELATEDNESS BETWEEN CONCEPTS. CONCEPT SENTENCE EMBEDDING OUTPERFORMS PATH-BASED MEASUREMENTS AND CUI2VEC, AND CAN BE FURTHER ENHANCED BY COMBINING WITH GRAPH EMBEDDING.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
USING CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS TO IDENTIFY PATIENT SAFETY INCIDENT REPORTS BY TYPE AND SEVERITY. OBJECTIVE: TO EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY OF A CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (CNN) WITH WORD EMBEDDING TO IDENTIFY THE TYPE AND SEVERITY OF PATIENT SAFETY INCIDENT REPORTS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A CNN WITH WORD EMBEDDING WAS APPLIED TO IDENTIFY 10 INCIDENT TYPES AND 4 SEVERITY LEVELS. MODEL TRAINING AND VALIDATION USED DATA SETS (N_TYPE = 2860, N_SEVERITY = 1160) COLLECTED FROM A STATEWIDE INCIDENT REPORTING SYSTEM. GENERALIZABILITY WAS EVALUATED USING AN INDEPENDENT HOSPITAL-LEVEL REPORTING SYSTEM. CNN ARCHITECTURES WERE EXAMINED BY VARYING LAYER SIZE AND HYPERPARAMETERS. PERFORMANCE WAS EVALUATED BY F SCORE, PRECISION, RECALL, AND COMPARED TO BINARY SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE (SVM) ENSEMBLES ON 3 TESTING DATA SETS (TYPE/SEVERITY: N_BENCHMARK = 286/116, N_ORIGINAL = 444/4837, N_INDEPENDENT = 6000/5950). RESULTS: A CNN WITH 6 LAYERS WAS THE MOST EFFECTIVE ARCHITECTURE, OUTPERFORMING SVMS WITH BETTER GENERALIZABILITY TO IDENTIFY INCIDENTS BY TYPE AND SEVERITY. THE CNN ACHIEVED HIGH F SCORES (> 85%) ACROSS ALL TEST DATA SETS WHEN IDENTIFYING COMMON INCIDENT TYPES INCLUDING FALLS, MEDICATIONS, PRESSURE INJURY, AND AGGRESSION. WHEN IDENTIFYING COMMON SEVERITY LEVELS (MEDIUM/LOW), CNN OUTPERFORMED SVMS, IMPROVING F SCORES BY 11.9%-45.1% ACROSS ALL 3 TEST DATA SETS. DISCUSSION: AUTOMATED IDENTIFICATION OF INCIDENT REPORTS USING MACHINE LEARNING IS CHALLENGING BECAUSE OF A LACK OF LARGE LABELLED TRAINING DATA SETS AND THE UNBALANCED DISTRIBUTION OF INCIDENT CLASSES. THE STANDARD CLASSIFICATION STRATEGY IS TO BUILD MULTIPLE BINARY CLASSIFIERS AND POOL THEIR PREDICTIONS. CNNS CAN EXTRACT HIERARCHICAL FEATURES AND ASSIST IN ADDRESSING CLASS IMBALANCE, WHICH MAY EXPLAIN THEIR SUCCESS IN IDENTIFYING INCIDENT REPORT TYPES. CONCLUSION: A CNN WITH WORD EMBEDDING WAS EFFECTIVE IN IDENTIFYING INCIDENTS BY TYPE AND SEVERITY, PROVIDING BETTER GENERALIZABILITY THAN SVMS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
USING DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS AND BIOLOGICAL SUBWORDS TO DETECT PROTEIN S-SULFENYLATION SITES. PROTEIN S-SULFENYLATION IS ONE KIND OF CRUCIAL POST-TRANSLATIONAL MODIFICATIONS (PTMS) IN WHICH THE HYDROXYL GROUP COVALENTLY BINDS TO THE THIOL OF CYSTEINE. SOME RECENT STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT THIS MODIFICATION PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN SIGNALING TRANSDUCTION, TRANSCRIPTIONAL REGULATION AND APOPTOSIS. TO DATE, THE DYNAMIC OF SULFENIC ACIDS IN PROTEINS REMAINS UNCLEAR BECAUSE OF ITS FLEETING NATURE. IDENTIFYING S-SULFENYLATION SITES, THEREFORE, COULD BE THE KEY TO DECIPHER ITS MYSTERIOUS STRUCTURES AND FUNCTIONS, WHICH ARE IMPORTANT IN CELL BIOLOGY AND DISEASES. HOWEVER, DUE TO THE LACK OF EFFECTIVE METHODS, SCIENTISTS IN THIS FIELD TEND TO BE LIMITED IN MERELY A HANDFUL OF SOME WET LAB TECHNIQUES THAT ARE TIME-CONSUMING AND NOT COST-EFFECTIVE. THUS, THIS MOTIVATED US TO DEVELOP AN IN SILICO MODEL FOR DETECTING S-SULFENYLATION SITES ONLY FROM PROTEIN SEQUENCE INFORMATION. IN THIS STUDY, PROTEIN SEQUENCES SERVED AS NATURAL LANGUAGE SENTENCES COMPRISING BIOLOGICAL SUBWORDS. THE DEEP NEURAL NETWORK WAS CONSEQUENTIALLY EMPLOYED TO PERFORM CLASSIFICATION. THE PERFORMANCE STATISTICS WITHIN THE INDEPENDENT DATASET INCLUDING SENSITIVITY, SPECIFICITY, ACCURACY, MATTHEWS CORRELATION COEFFICIENT AND AREA UNDER THE CURVE RATES ACHIEVED 85.71%, 69.47%, 77.09%, 0.5554 AND 0.833, RESPECTIVELY. OUR RESULTS SUGGESTED THAT THE PROPOSED METHOD (FASTSULF-DNN) ACHIEVED EXCELLENT PERFORMANCE IN PREDICTING S-SULFENYLATION SITES COMPARED TO OTHER WELL-KNOWN TOOLS ON A BENCHMARK DATASET.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
USING LANGUAGE REPRESENTATION LEARNING APPROACH TO EFFICIENTLY IDENTIFY PROTEIN COMPLEX CATEGORIES IN ELECTRON TRANSPORT CHAIN. WE HEREIN PROPOSED A NOVEL APPROACH BASED ON THE LANGUAGE REPRESENTATION LEARNING METHOD TO CATEGORIZE ELECTRON COMPLEX PROTEINS INTO 5 TYPES. THE IDEA IS STEMMED FROM THE THE SHARED CHARACTERISTICS OF HUMAN LANGUAGE AND PROTEIN SEQUENCE LANGUAGE, THUS ADVANCED NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING TECHNIQUES WERE USED FOR EXTRACTING USEFUL FEATURES. SPECIFICALLY, WE EMPLOYED TRANSFER LEARNING AND WORD EMBEDDING TECHNIQUES TO ANALYZE ELECTRON COMPLEX SEQUENCES AND CREATE EFFICIENT FEATURE SETS BEFORE USING A SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE ALGORITHM TO CLASSIFY THEM. DURING THE 5-FOLD CROSS-VALIDATION PROCESSES, SEVEN TYPES OF SEQUENCE-BASED FEATURES WERE ANALYZED TO FIND THE OPTIMAL FEATURES. ON AN AVERAGE, OUR FINAL CLASSIFICATION MODELS ACHIEVED THE ACCURACY, SPECIFICITY, SENSITIVITY, AND MCC OF 96 %, 96.1 %, 95.3 %, AND 0.86, RESPECTIVELY ON CROSS-VALIDATION DATA. FOR THE INDEPENDENT TEST DATA, THOSE CORRESPONDING PERFORMANCE SCORES ARE 95.3 %, 92.6 %, 94 %, AND 0.87. WE CONCLUDED THAT USING FEATURE EXTRACTED USING THESE REPRESENTATION LEARNING METHODS, THE PREDICTION PERFORMANCE OF SIMPLE MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHM IS ON PAR WITH EXISTING DEEP NEURAL NETWORK METHOD ON THE TASK OF CATEGORIZING ELECTRON COMPLEXES WHILE ENJOYING A MUCH FASTER WAY FOR FEATURE GENERATION. FURTHERMORE, THE RESULTS ALSO SHOWED THAT THE COMBINATION OF FEATURES LEARNED FROM THE REPRESENTATION LEARNING METHODS AND SEQUENCE MOTIF COUNTS HELPS YIELD BETTER PERFORMANCE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
USING WORD EMBEDDING TECHNIQUE TO EFFICIENTLY REPRESENT PROTEIN SEQUENCES FOR IDENTIFYING SUBSTRATE SPECIFICITIES OF TRANSPORTERS. MEMBRANE TRANSPORT PROTEINS AND THEIR SUBSTRATE SPECIFICITIES PLAY CRUCIAL ROLES IN VARIOUS CELLULAR FUNCTIONS. IDENTIFYING THE SUBSTRATE SPECIFICITIES OF MEMBRANE TRANSPORT PROTEINS IS CLOSELY RELATED TO PROTEIN-TARGET INTERACTION PREDICTION, DRUG DESIGN, MEMBRANE RECRUITMENT, AND DYSREGULATION ANALYSIS, THUS BEING AN IMPORTANT PROBLEM FOR BIOINFORMATICS RESEARCHERS. IN THIS STUDY, WE APPLIED WORD EMBEDDING APPROACH, THE MAIN CAUSE FOR NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING BREAKOUT IN RECENT YEARS, TO PROTEIN SEQUENCES OF TRANSPORTERS. WE DEFINED EACH PROTEIN SEQUENCE BASED ON THE WORD EMBEDDINGS AND FREQUENCIES OF ITS BIOLOGICAL WORDS. THE PROTEIN FEATURES WERE THEN FED INTO MACHINE LEARNING MODELS FOR PREDICTION. WE ALSO VARIED THE LENGTHS OF PROTEIN SEQUENCE'S CONSTITUENT BIOLOGICAL WORDS TO FIND THE OPTIMAL LENGTH WHICH GENERATED THE MOST DISCRIMINATIVE FEATURE SET. COMPARED TO FOUR OTHER FEATURE TYPES CREATED FROM PROTEIN SEQUENCES, OUR PROPOSED FEATURES CAN HELP PREDICTION MODELS YIELD SUPERIOR PERFORMANCE. OUR BEST MODELS REACH AN AVERAGE AREA UNDER THE CURVE OF 0.96 AND 0.99, RESPECTIVELY ON THE 5-FOLD CROSS VALIDATION AND THE INDEPENDENT TEST. WITH THIS RESULT, OUR STUDY CAN HELP BIOLOGISTS IDENTIFY TRANSPORTERS BASED ON SUBSTRATE SPECIFICITIES AS WELL AS PROVIDES A BASIS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH THAT ENRICHES A FIELD OF APPLYING NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING TECHNIQUES IN BIOINFORMATICS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
USING WORD EMBEDDINGS TO EXPAND TERMINOLOGY OF DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS ON CLINICAL NOTES. OBJECTIVE: THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY IS TO DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF APPLYING WORD EMBEDDINGS TO EXPAND THE TERMINOLOGY OF DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS (DS) USING OVER 26 MILLION CLINICAL NOTES. METHODS: WORD EMBEDDING MODELS (IE, WORD2VEC AND GLOVE) TRAINED ON CLINICAL NOTES WERE USED TO PREDEFINE A LIST OF TOP 40 SEMANTICALLY RELATED TERMS FOR EACH OF 14 COMMONLY USED DS. EACH LIST WAS FURTHER EVALUATED BY EXPERTS TO GENERATE SEMANTICALLY SIMILAR TERMS. WE INVESTIGATED THE EFFECT OF CORPUS SIZE AND OTHER SETTINGS (IE, VECTOR SIZE AND WINDOW SIZE) AS WELL AS THE 2 WORD EMBEDDING MODELS ON PERFORMANCE FOR DS TERM EXPANSION. WE COMPARED THE NUMBER OF CLINICAL NOTES (AND PATIENTS THEY REPRESENT) THAT WERE RETRIEVED USING THE WORD EMBEDDING EXPANDED TERMS TO BOTH THE BASELINE TERMS AND EXTERNAL DS SOURCES EXANDPED TERMS. RESULTS: USING THE WORD EMBEDDING MODELS TRAINED ON CLINICAL NOTES, WE COULD IDENTIFY 1-12 SEMANTICALLY SIMILAR TERMS FOR EACH DS. USING THE WORD EMBEDDING EXANDPED TERMS, WE WERE ABLE TO RETRIEVE AVERAGELY 8.39% MORE CLINICAL NOTES AND 11.68% MORE PATIENTS FOR EACH DS COMPARED WITH 2 SETS OF TERMS. THE INCREASING CORPUS SIZE RESULTS IN MORE MISSPELLINGS, BUT NOT MORE SEMANTIC VARIANTS BRAND NAMES. WORD2VEC MODEL IS ALSO FOUND MORE CAPABLE OF DETECTING SEMANTICALLY SIMILAR TERMS THAN GLOVE. CONCLUSION: OUR STUDY DEMONSTRATES THE UTILITY OF WORD EMBEDDINGS ON CLINICAL NOTES FOR TERMINOLOGY EXPANSION ON 14 DS. WE PROPOSE THAT THIS METHOD CAN BE POTENTIALLY APPLIED TO CREATE A DS VOCABULARY FOR DOWNSTREAM APPLICATIONS, SUCH AS INFORMATION EXTRACTION.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
USING WORD EMBEDDINGS TO INVESTIGATE CULTURAL BIASES. WORD EMBEDDINGS PROVIDE QUANTITATIVE REPRESENTATIONS OF WORD SEMANTICS AND THE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN WORD MEANINGS IN TEXT DATA, INCLUDING IN LARGE REPOSITORIES IN MEDIA AND SOCIAL MEDIA ARCHIVES. THIS ARTICLE INTRODUCES SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGISTS TO WORD EMBEDDING RESEARCH VIA A CONSIDERATION OF BIAS ANALYSIS, A TOPIC OF CENTRAL CONCERN IN THE DISCIPLINE. WE EXPLAIN HOW WORD EMBEDDINGS ARE CONSTRUCTED AND HOW THEY CAN BE USED TO MEASURE BIAS ALONG BIPOLAR DIMENSIONS THAT ARE COMPARABLE TO SEMANTIC DIFFERENTIAL SCALES. WE REVIEW RECENT STUDIES THAT SHOW HOW FAMILIAR SOCIAL BIASES CAN BE DETECTED IN EMBEDDINGS AND HOW THESE CHANGE OVER TIME AND IN CONJUNCTION WITH REAL-WORLD DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES. THE EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT EMBEDDINGS YIELD VALID AND RELIABLE ESTIMATES OF BIAS AND THAT THEY CAN IDENTIFY SUBTLE BIASES THAT MAY NOT BE COMMUNICATED EXPLICITLY. WE ARGUE THAT WORD EMBEDDING RESEARCH CAN EXTEND SCHOLARSHIP ON PREJUDICE AND STEREOTYPING, PROVIDING MEASURES OF THE BIAS ENVIRONMENT OF HUMAN THOUGHT AND ACTION.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
VARIABLE LENGTH CHARACTER N-GRAM EMBEDDING OF PROTEIN SEQUENCES FOR SECONDARY STRUCTURE PREDICTION. BACKGROUND: THE PREDICTION OF A PROTEIN'S SECONDARY STRUCTURE FROM ITS AMINO ACID SEQUENCE IS AN ESSENTIAL STEP TOWARDS PREDICTING ITS 3-D STRUCTURE. THE PREDICTION PERFORMANCE IMPROVES BY INCORPORATING HOMOLOGOUS MULTIPLE SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT INFORMATION. SINCE HOMOLOGOUS DETAILS NOT AVAILABLE FOR ALL PROTEINS. THEREFORE, IT IS NECESSARY TO PREDICT THE PROTEIN SECONDARY STRUCTURE FROM SINGLE SEQUENCES. OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: PROTEIN SECONDARY STRUCTURE PREDICTED FROM THEIR PRIMARY SEQUENCES USING N-GRAM WORD EMBEDDING AND DEEP RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORK. PROTEIN SECONDARY STRUCTURE DEPENDS ON LOCAL AND LONG-RANGE NEIGHBOR RESIDUES IN PRIMARY SEQUENCES. IN THE PROPOSED WORK, THE LOCAL CONTEXTUAL INFORMATION OF AMINO ACID RESIDUES CAPTURES VARIABLE-LENGTH CHARACTER N-GRAM WORDS. AN EMBEDDING VECTOR REPRESENTS THESE VARIABLE-LENGTH CHARACTER N-GRAM WORDS. FURTHER, THE BIDIRECTIONAL LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY (BI-LSTM) MODEL IS USED TO CAPTURE THE LONG-RANGE CONTEXTS BY EXTRACTING THE PAST AND FUTURE RESIDUES INFORMATION IN PRIMARY SEQUENCES. RESULTS: THE PROPOSED MODEL EVALUATES ON THREE PUBLIC DATASETS SS.TXT, RS126, AND CASP9. THE MODEL SHOWS THE Q3 ACCURACY OF 92.57%, 86.48%, AND 89.66% FOR SS.TXT, RS126, AND CASP9. CONCLUSION: THE PROPOSED MODEL PERFORMANCE COMPARES WITH STATE-OF-THE-ART METHODS AVAILABLE IN THE LITERATURE. AFTER A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS, IT OBSERVED THAT THE PROPOSED MODEL PERFORMS BETTER THAN STATE-OF-THE-ART METHODS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
VECTOR REPRESENTATION BASED ON A SUPERVISED CODEBOOK FOR NEPALI DOCUMENTS CLASSIFICATION. DOCUMENT REPRESENTATION WITH OUTLIER TOKENS EXACERBATES THE CLASSIFICATION PERFORMANCE DUE TO THE UNCERTAIN ORIENTATION OF SUCH TOKENS. MOST EXISTING DOCUMENT REPRESENTATION METHODS IN DIFFERENT LANGUAGES INCLUDING NEPALI MOSTLY IGNORE THE STRATEGIES TO FILTER THEM OUT FROM DOCUMENTS BEFORE LEARNING THEIR REPRESENTATIONS. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE PROPOSE A NOVEL DOCUMENT REPRESENTATION METHOD BASED ON A SUPERVISED CODEBOOK TO REPRESENT THE NEPALI DOCUMENTS, WHERE OUR CODEBOOK CONTAINS ONLY SEMANTIC TOKENS WITHOUT OUTLIERS. OUR CODEBOOK IS DOMAIN-SPECIFIC AS IT IS BASED ON TOKENS IN A GIVEN CORPUS THAT HAVE HIGHER SIMILARITIES WITH THE CLASS LABELS IN THE CORPUS. OUR METHOD ADOPTS A SIMPLE YET PROMINENT REPRESENTATION METHOD FOR EACH WORD, CALLED PROBABILITY-BASED WORD EMBEDDING. TO SHOW THE EFFICACY OF OUR METHOD, WE EVALUATE ITS PERFORMANCE IN THE DOCUMENT CLASSIFICATION TASK USING SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE AND VALIDATE AGAINST WIDELY USED DOCUMENT REPRESENTATION METHODS SUCH AS BAG OF WORDS, LATENT DIRICHLET ALLOCATION, LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY, WORD2VEC, BIDIRECTIONAL ENCODER REPRESENTATIONS FROM TRANSFORMERS AND SO ON, USING FOUR NEPALI TEXT DATASETS (WE DENOTE THEM SHORTLY AS A1, A2, A3 AND A4). THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS SHOW THAT OUR METHOD PRODUCES STATE-OF-THE-ART CLASSIFICATION PERFORMANCE (77.46% ACCURACY ON A1, 67.53% ACCURACY ON A2, 80.54% ACCURACY ON A3 AND 89.58% ACCURACY ON A4) COMPARED TO THE WIDELY USED EXISTING DOCUMENT REPRESENTATION METHODS. IT YIELDS THE BEST CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY ON THREE DATASETS (A1, A2 AND A3) AND A COMPARABLE ACCURACY ON THE FOURTH DATASET (A4). FURTHERMORE, WE INTRODUCE THE LARGEST NEPALI DOCUMENT DATASET (A4), CALLED NEPALILINGUISTIC DATASET, TO THE LINGUISTIC COMMUNITY.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
VIRSEARCHER: IDENTIFYING BACTERIOPHAGES FROM METAGENOMES BY COMBINING CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK AND GENE INFORMATION. METAGENOME SEQUENCING PROVIDES AN UNPRECEDENTED OPPORTUNITY FOR THE DISCOVERY OF UNKNOWN MICROBES AND VIRUSES. A LARGE NUMBER OF PHAGES AND PROKARYOTES ARE MIXED TOGETHER IN METAGENOMES. TO STUDY THE INFLUENCE OF PHAGES ON HUMAN BODIES AND ENVIRONMENTS, IT IS OF GREAT SIGNIFICANCE TO ISOLATE PHAGES FROM METAGENOMES. HOWEVER, IT IS DIFFICULT TO IDENTIFY NOVEL PHAGES BECAUSE OF THE DIVERSITY OF THEIR SEQUENCES AND THE FREQUENT PRESENCE OF SHORT CONTIGS IN METAGENOMES. HERE, VIRSEARCHER IS DEVELOPED TO IDENTIFY PHAGES FROM METAGENOMES BY COMBINING THE CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (CNN) AND THE GENE INFORMATION OF INPUT SEQUENCES. FIRSTLY, AN INPUT SEQUENCE IS ENCODED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS OF ITS CODING AND THE NON-CODING REGIONS AND THEN IS CONVERTED INTO WORD EMBEDDING CODE THROUGH A WORD EMBEDDING LAYER BEFORE A CONVOLUTIONAL LAYER. MEANWHILE, THE HIT RATIO OF THE VIRUS GENES IS COMBINED WITH THE OUTPUT OF THE CNN TO FURTHER IMPROVE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE NETWORK. THE GENES USED BY VIRSEARCHER CONSIST OF COMPLETE AND INCOMPLETE GENES. EXPERIMENTS ON SEVERAL METAGENOMES HAVE SHOWED THAT, COMPARED WITH OTHERS, VIRSEARCHER CAN SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE THE PERFORMANCE FOR THE IDENTIFICATION OF SHORT SEQUENCES, WHILE MAINTAINING THE PERFORMANCE FOR LONG ONES.

A WORD EMBEDDING MODEL WAS TRAINED ON POSTS TO FACILITATE THE IDENTIFICATION OF PATTERNS ASSOCIATED WITH ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
VISUALIZATION OF MEDICAL CONCEPTS REPRESENTED USING WORD EMBEDDINGS: A SCOPING REVIEW. BACKGROUND: ANALYZING THE UNSTRUCTURED TEXTUAL DATA CONTAINED IN ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS (EHRS) HAS ALWAYS BEEN A CHALLENGING TASK. WORD EMBEDDING METHODS HAVE BECOME AN ESSENTIAL FOUNDATION FOR NEURAL NETWORK-BASED APPROACHES IN NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP), TO LEARN DENSE AND LOW-DIMENSIONAL WORD REPRESENTATIONS FROM LARGE UNLABELED CORPORA THAT CAPTURE THE IMPLICIT SEMANTICS OF WORDS. MODELS LIKE WORD2VEC, GLOVE OR FASTTEXT HAVE BEEN BROADLY APPLIED AND REVIEWED IN THE BIOINFORMATICS AND HEALTHCARE FIELDS, MOST OFTEN TO EMBED CLINICAL NOTES OR ACTIVITY AND DIAGNOSTIC CODES. VISUALIZATION OF THE LEARNED EMBEDDINGS HAS BEEN USED IN A SUBSET OF THESE WORKS, WHETHER FOR EXPLORATORY OR EVALUATION PURPOSES. HOWEVER, VISUALIZATION PRACTICES TEND TO BE HETEROGENEOUS, AND LACK OVERALL GUIDELINES. OBJECTIVE: THIS SCOPING REVIEW AIMS TO DESCRIBE THE METHODS AND STRATEGIES USED TO VISUALIZE MEDICAL CONCEPTS REPRESENTED USING WORD EMBEDDING METHODS. WE AIM TO UNDERSTAND THE OBJECTIVES OF THE VISUALIZATIONS AND THEIR LIMITS. METHODS: THIS SCOPING REVIEW SUMMARIZES DIFFERENT METHODS USED TO VISUALIZE WORD EMBEDDINGS IN HEALTHCARE. WE FOLLOWED THE METHODOLOGY PROPOSED BY ARKSEY AND O'MALLEY (INT J SOC RES METHODOL 8:19-32, 2005) AND BY LEVAC ET AL. (IMPLEMENT SCI 5:69, 2010) TO BETTER ANALYZE THE DATA AND PROVIDE A SYNTHESIS OF THE LITERATURE ON THE MATTER. RESULTS: WE FIRST OBTAINED 471 UNIQUE ARTICLES FROM A SEARCH CONDUCTED IN PUBMED, MEDRXIV AND ARXIV DATABASES. 30 OF THESE WERE EFFECTIVELY REVIEWED, BASED ON OUR INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA. 23 ARTICLES WERE EXCLUDED IN THE FULL REVIEW STAGE, RESULTING IN THE ANALYSIS OF 7 PAPERS THAT FULLY CORRESPOND TO OUR INCLUSION CRITERIA. INCLUDED PAPERS PURSUED A VARIETY OF OBJECTIVES AND USED DISTINCT METHODS TO EVALUATE THEIR EMBEDDINGS AND TO VISUALIZE THEM. VISUALIZATION ALSO SERVED HETEROGENEOUS PURPOSES, BEING ALTERNATIVELY USED AS A WAY TO EXPLORE THE EMBEDDINGS, TO EVALUATE THEM OR TO MERELY ILLUSTRATE PROPERTIES OTHERWISE FORMALLY ASSESSED. CONCLUSIONS: VISUALIZATION HELPS TO EXPLORE EMBEDDING RESULTS (FURTHER DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION, SYNTHETIC REPRESENTATION). HOWEVER, IT DOES NOT EXHAUST THE INFORMATION CONVEYED BY THE EMBEDDINGS NOR CONSTITUTE A SELF-SUSTAINING EVALUATION METHOD OF THEIR PERTINENCE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
VITALITY: PROMOTING SERENDIPITOUS DISCOVERY OF ACADEMIC LITERATURE WITH TRANSFORMERS & VISUAL ANALYTICS. THERE ARE A FEW PROMINENT PRACTICES FOR CONDUCTING REVIEWS OF ACADEMIC LITERATURE, INCLUDING SEARCHING FOR SPECIFIC KEYWORDS ON GOOGLE SCHOLAR OR CHECKING CITATIONS FROM SOME INITIAL SEED PAPER(S). THESE APPROACHES SERVE A CRITICAL PURPOSE FOR ACADEMIC LITERATURE REVIEWS, YET THERE REMAIN CHALLENGES IN IDENTIFYING RELEVANT LITERATURE WHEN SIMILAR WORK MAY UTILIZE DIFFERENT TERMINOLOGY (E.G., MIXED-INITIATIVE VISUAL ANALYTICS PAPERS MAY NOT USE THE SAME TERMINOLOGY AS PAPERS ON MODEL-STEERING, YET THE TWO TOPICS ARE RELEVANT TO ONE ANOTHER). IN THIS PAPER, WE INTRODUCE A SYSTEM, VITALITY, INTENDED TO COMPLEMENT EXISTING PRACTICES. IN PARTICULAR, VITALITY PROMOTES SERENDIPITOUS DISCOVERY OF RELEVANT LITERATURE USING TRANSFORMER LANGUAGE MODELS, ALLOWING USERS TO FIND SEMANTICALLY SIMILAR PAPERS IN A WORD EMBEDDING SPACE GIVEN (1) A LIST OF INPUT PAPER(S) OR (2) A WORKING ABSTRACT. VITALITY VISUALIZES THIS DOCUMENT-LEVEL EMBEDDING SPACE IN AN INTERACTIVE 2-D SCATTERPLOT USING DIMENSION REDUCTION. VITALITY ALSO SUMMARIZES META INFORMATION ABOUT THE DOCUMENT CORPUS OR SEARCH QUERY, INCLUDING KEYWORDS AND CO-AUTHORS, AND ALLOWS USERS TO SAVE AND EXPORT PAPERS FOR USE IN A LITERATURE REVIEW. WE PRESENT QUALITATIVE FINDINGS FROM AN EVALUATION OF VITALITY, SUGGESTING IT CAN BE A PROMISING COMPLEMENTARY TECHNIQUE FOR CONDUCTING ACADEMIC LITERATURE REVIEWS. FURTHERMORE, WE CONTRIBUTE DATA FROM 38 POPULAR DATA VISUALIZATION PUBLICATION VENUES IN VITALITY, AND WE PROVIDE SCRAPERS FOR THE OPEN-SOURCE COMMUNITY TO CONTINUE TO GROW THE LIST OF SUPPORTED VENUES.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
WEAKLY SUPERVISED NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING FOR ASSESSING PATIENT-CENTERED OUTCOME FOLLOWING PROSTATE CANCER TREATMENT. BACKGROUND: THE POPULATION-BASED ASSESSMENT OF PATIENT-CENTERED OUTCOMES (PCOS) HAS BEEN LIMITED BY THE EFFICIENT AND ACCURATE COLLECTION OF THESE DATA. NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) PIPELINES CAN DETERMINE WHETHER A CLINICAL NOTE WITHIN AN ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORD CONTAINS EVIDENCE ON THESE DATA. WE PRESENT AND DEMONSTRATE THE ACCURACY OF AN NLP PIPELINE THAT TARGETS TO ASSESS THE PRESENCE, ABSENCE, OR RISK DISCUSSION OF TWO IMPORTANT PCOS FOLLOWING PROSTATE CANCER TREATMENT: URINARY INCONTINENCE (UI) AND BOWEL DYSFUNCTION (BD). METHODS: WE PROPOSE A WEAKLY SUPERVISED NLP APPROACH WHICH ANNOTATES ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORD CLINICAL NOTES WITHOUT REQUIRING MANUAL CHART REVIEW. A WEIGHTED FUNCTION OF NEURAL WORD EMBEDDING WAS USED TO CREATE A SENTENCE-LEVEL VECTOR REPRESENTATION OF RELEVANT EXPRESSIONS EXTRACTED FROM THE CLINICAL NOTES. SENTENCE VECTORS WERE USED AS INPUT FOR A MULTINOMIAL LOGISTIC MODEL, WITH OUTPUT BEING EITHER PRESENCE, ABSENCE OR RISK DISCUSSION OF UI/BD. THE CLASSIFIER WAS TRAINED BASED ON AUTOMATED SENTENCE ANNOTATION DEPENDING ONLY ON DOMAIN-SPECIFIC DICTIONARIES (WEAK SUPERVISION). RESULTS: THE MODEL ACHIEVED AN AVERAGE F1 SCORE OF 0.86 FOR THE SENTENCE-LEVEL, THREE-TIER CLASSIFICATION TASK (PRESENCE/ABSENCE/RISK) IN BOTH UI AND BD. THE MODEL ALSO OUTPERFORMED A PRE-EXISTING RULE-BASED MODEL FOR NOTE-LEVEL ANNOTATION OF UI WITH SIGNIFICANT MARGIN. CONCLUSIONS: WE DEMONSTRATE A MACHINE LEARNING METHOD TO CATEGORIZE CLINICAL NOTES BASED ON IMPORTANT PCOS THAT TRAINS A CLASSIFIER ON SENTENCE VECTOR REPRESENTATIONS LABELED WITH A DOMAIN-SPECIFIC DICTIONARY, WHICH ELIMINATES THE NEED FOR MANUAL ENGINEERING OF LINGUISTIC RULES OR MANUAL CHART REVIEW FOR EXTRACTING THE PCOS. THE WEAKLY SUPERVISED NLP PIPELINE SHOWED PROMISING SENSITIVITY AND SPECIFICITY FOR IDENTIFYING IMPORTANT PCOS IN UNSTRUCTURED CLINICAL TEXT NOTES COMPARED TO RULE-BASED ALGORITHMS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
WET: WORD EMBEDDING-TOPIC DISTRIBUTION VECTORS FOR MOOC VIDEO LECTURES DATASET. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE PRESENT A DATASET CONTAINING WORD EMBEDDINGS AND DOCUMENT TOPIC DISTRIBUTION VECTORS GENERATED FROM MOOCS VIDEO LECTURE TRANSCRIPTS. TRANSCRIPTS OF 12,032 VIDEO LECTURES FROM 200 COURSES WERE COLLECTED FROM COURSERA LEARNING PLATFORM. THIS LARGE CORPUS OF TRANSCRIPTS WAS USED AS INPUT TO TWO WELL-KNOWN NLP TECHNIQUES, NAMELY WORD2VEC AND LATENT DIRICHLET ALLOCATION (LDA) TO GENERATE WORD EMBEDDINGS AND TOPIC VECTORS, RESPECTIVELY. WE USED WORD2VEC AND LDA IMPLEMENTATION IN THE GENSIM PACKAGE IN PYTHON. THE DATA PRESENTED IN THIS ARTICLE ARE RELATED TO THE RESEARCH ARTICLE ENTITLED "INTEGRATING WORD EMBEDDINGS AND DOCUMENT TOPICS WITH DEEP LEARNING IN A VIDEO CLASSIFICATION FRAMEWORK" [1]. THE DATASET IS HOSTED IN THE MENDELEY DATA REPOSITORY [2].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
WIDE RANGE SCREENING OF ALGORITHMIC BIAS IN WORD EMBEDDING MODELS USING LARGE SENTIMENT LEXICONS REVEALS UNDERREPORTED BIAS TYPES. CONCERNS ABOUT GENDER BIAS IN WORD EMBEDDING MODELS HAVE CAPTURED SUBSTANTIAL ATTENTION IN THE ALGORITHMIC BIAS RESEARCH LITERATURE. OTHER BIAS TYPES HOWEVER HAVE RECEIVED LESSER AMOUNTS OF SCRUTINY. THIS WORK DESCRIBES A LARGE-SCALE ANALYSIS OF SENTIMENT ASSOCIATIONS IN POPULAR WORD EMBEDDING MODELS ALONG THE LINES OF GENDER AND ETHNICITY BUT ALSO ALONG THE LESS FREQUENTLY STUDIED DIMENSIONS OF SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS, AGE, PHYSICAL APPEARANCE, SEXUAL ORIENTATION, RELIGIOUS SENTIMENT AND POLITICAL LEANINGS. CONSISTENT WITH PREVIOUS SCHOLARLY LITERATURE, THIS WORK HAS FOUND SYSTEMIC BIAS AGAINST GIVEN NAMES POPULAR AMONG AFRICAN-AMERICANS IN MOST EMBEDDING MODELS EXAMINED. GENDER BIAS IN EMBEDDING MODELS HOWEVER APPEARS TO BE MULTIFACETED AND OFTEN REVERSED IN POLARITY TO WHAT HAS BEEN REGULARLY REPORTED. INTERESTINGLY, USING THE COMMON OPERATIONALIZATION OF THE TERM BIAS IN THE FAIRNESS LITERATURE, NOVEL TYPES OF SO FAR UNREPORTED BIAS TYPES IN WORD EMBEDDING MODELS HAVE ALSO BEEN IDENTIFIED. SPECIFICALLY, THE POPULAR EMBEDDING MODELS ANALYZED HERE DISPLAY NEGATIVE BIASES AGAINST MIDDLE AND WORKING-CLASS SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS, MALE CHILDREN, SENIOR CITIZENS, PLAIN PHYSICAL APPEARANCE AND INTELLECTUAL PHENOMENA SUCH AS ISLAMIC RELIGIOUS FAITH, NON-RELIGIOSITY AND CONSERVATIVE POLITICAL ORIENTATION. REASONS FOR THE PARADOXICAL UNDERREPORTING OF THESE BIAS TYPES IN THE RELEVANT LITERATURE ARE PROBABLY MANIFOLD BUT WIDELY HELD BLIND SPOTS WHEN SEARCHING FOR ALGORITHMIC BIAS AND A LACK OF WIDESPREAD TECHNICAL JARGON TO UNAMBIGUOUSLY DESCRIBE A VARIETY OF ALGORITHMIC ASSOCIATIONS COULD CONCEIVABLY BE PLAYING A ROLE. THE CAUSAL ORIGINS FOR THE MULTIPLICITY OF LOADED ASSOCIATIONS ATTACHED TO DISTINCT DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS WITHIN EMBEDDING MODELS ARE OFTEN UNCLEAR BUT THE HETEROGENEITY OF SAID ASSOCIATIONS AND THEIR POTENTIAL MULTIFACTORIAL ROOTS RAISES DOUBTS ABOUT THE VALIDITY OF GROUPING THEM ALL UNDER THE UMBRELLA TERM BIAS. RICHER AND MORE FINE-GRAINED TERMINOLOGY AS WELL AS A MORE COMPREHENSIVE EXPLORATION OF THE BIAS LANDSCAPE COULD HELP THE FAIRNESS EPISTEMIC COMMUNITY TO CHARACTERIZE AND NEUTRALIZE ALGORITHMIC DISCRIMINATION MORE EFFICIENTLY.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
WORD AND SENTENCE EMBEDDING TOOLS TO MEASURE SEMANTIC SIMILARITY OF GENE ONTOLOGY TERMS BY THEIR DEFINITIONS. THE GENE ONTOLOGY (GO) DATABASE CONTAINS GO TERMS THAT DESCRIBE BIOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS OF GENES. PREVIOUS METHODS FOR COMPARING GO TERMS HAVE RELIED ON THE FACT THAT GO TERMS ARE ORGANIZED INTO A TREE STRUCTURE. UNDER THIS PARADIGM, THE LOCATIONS OF TWO GO TERMS IN THE TREE DICTATE THEIR SIMILARITY SCORE. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE INTRODUCE TWO NEW SOLUTIONS FOR THIS PROBLEM BY FOCUSING INSTEAD ON THE DEFINITIONS OF THE GO TERMS. WE APPLY NEURAL NETWORK-BASED TECHNIQUES FROM THE NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) DOMAIN. THE FIRST METHOD DOES NOT RELY ON THE GO TREE, WHEREAS THE SECOND INDIRECTLY DEPENDS ON THE GO TREE. IN OUR FIRST APPROACH, WE COMPARE TWO GO DEFINITIONS BY TREATING THEM AS TWO UNORDERED SETS OF WORDS. THE WORD SIMILARITY IS ESTIMATED BY A WORD EMBEDDING MODEL THAT MAPS WORDS INTO AN N-DIMENSIONAL SPACE. IN OUR SECOND APPROACH, WE ACCOUNT FOR THE WORD-ORDERING WITHIN A SENTENCE. WE USE A SENTENCE ENCODER TO EMBED GO DEFINITIONS INTO VECTORS AND ESTIMATE HOW LIKELY ONE DEFINITION ENTAILS ANOTHER. WE VALIDATE OUR METHODS IN TWO WAYS. IN THE FIRST EXPERIMENT, WE TEST THE MODEL'S ABILITY TO DIFFERENTIATE A TRUE PROTEIN-PROTEIN NETWORK FROM A RANDOMLY GENERATED NETWORK. IN THE SECOND EXPERIMENT, WE TEST THE MODEL IN IDENTIFYING ORTHOLOGS FROM RANDOMLY MATCHED GENES IN HUMAN, MOUSE, AND FLY. IN BOTH EXPERIMENTS, A HYBRID OF NLP AND GO TREE-BASED METHOD ACHIEVES THE BEST CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
WORD EMBEDDING AND CLUSTERING FOR PATIENT-CENTERED REDESIGN OF APPOINTMENT SCHEDULING IN AMBULATORY CARE SETTINGS. BACKGROUND. A KEY TO A MORE EFFICIENT SCHEDULING SYSTEMS IS TO ENSURE APPOINTMENTS ARE DESIGNED TO MEET PATIENT'S NEEDS AND TO DESIGN AND SIMPLIFY APPOINTMENT SCHEDULING LESS PRONE TO ERROR. ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS (EHR) CONSIST OF VALUABLE INFORMATION ABOUT PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS AND THEIR HEALTHCARE NEEDS. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO UTILIZE INFORMATION FROM STRUCTURED AND UNSTRUCTURED EHR DATA TO REDESIGN APPOINTMENT SCHEDULING IN COMMUNITY HEALTH CLINICS. METHODS. WE USED GLOBAL VECTORS FOR WORD REPRESENTATION, A WORD EMBEDDING APPROACH, ON FREE TEXT FIELD "SCHEDULER NOTE" TO CLUSTER PATIENTS INTO GROUPS BASED ON SIMILARITIES OF REASONS FOR APPOINTMENT. WE THEN REDESIGNED AN APPOINTMENT SCHEDULING TEMPLATE WITH NEW TYPES AND DURATIONS BASED ON THE CLUSTERS. WE COMPARED THE CURRENT APPOINTMENT SCHEDULING SYSTEM AND OUR PROPOSED SYSTEM BY PREDICTING AND EVALUATING CLINIC PERFORMANCE MEASURES SUCH AS PATIENT TIME SPENT IN-CLINIC AND NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL PATIENTS TO ACCOMMODATE. RESULTS. WE COLLECTED 17,722 ENCOUNTERS OF AN URBAN COMMUNITY HEALTH CLINIC IN 2014 INCLUDING 102 UNIQUE TYPES RECORDED IN THE EHR. FOLLOWING DATA PROCESSING, WORD EMBEDDING IMPLEMENTATION, AND CLUSTERING, APPOINTMENT TYPES WERE GROUPED INTO 10 CLUSTERS. THE PROPOSED SCHEDULING TEMPLATE COULD OPEN SPACE TO SEE OVERALL AN ADDITIONAL 716 PATIENTS PER YEAR AND DECREASE PATIENT IN-CLINIC TIME BY 3.6 MINUTES ON AVERAGE (P-VALUE<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS. WE FOUND WORD EMBEDDING, THAT IS AN NLP APPROACH, CAN BE USED TO EXTRACT INFORMATION FROM SCHEDULERS NOTES FOR IMPROVING SCHEDULING SYSTEMS. UNSUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH CAN BE APPLIED TO SIMPLIFY APPOINTMENT SCHEDULING IN CHCS. PATIENT-CENTERED APPOINTMENT SCHEDULING CAN BE ACHIEVED BY SIMPLIFYING AND REDESIGNING APPOINTMENT TYPES AND DURATIONS THAT COULD IMPROVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES, SUCH AS INCREASING AVAILABILITY OF TIME AND PATIENT SATISFACTION.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
WORD EMBEDDING DISTRIBUTION PROPAGATION GRAPH NETWORK FOR FEW-SHOT LEARNING. FEW-SHOT LEARNING (FSL) IS OF GREAT SIGNIFICANCE TO THE FIELD OF MACHINE LEARNING. THE ABILITY TO LEARN AND GENERALIZE USING A SMALL NUMBER OF SAMPLES IS AN OBVIOUS DISTINCTION BETWEEN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND HUMANS. IN THE FSL DOMAIN, MOST GRAPH NEURAL NETWORKS (GNNS) FOCUS ON TRANSFERRING LABELED SAMPLE INFORMATION TO AN UNLABELED QUERY SAMPLE, IGNORING THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF SEMANTIC INFORMATION DURING THE CLASSIFICATION PROCESS. OUR PROPOSED METHOD EMBEDS SEMANTIC INFORMATION OF CLASSES INTO A GNN, CREATING A WORD EMBEDDING DISTRIBUTION PROPAGATION GRAPH NETWORK (WPGN) FOR FSL. WE MERGE THE ATTENTION MECHANISM WITH OUR BACKBONE NETWORK, USE THE MAHALANOBIS DISTANCE TO CALCULATE THE SIMILARITY OF CLASSES, SELECT THE FUNNEL RELU (FRELU) FUNCTION AS THE ACTIVATION FUNCTION OF THE TRANSFORM LAYER, AND UPDATE THE POINT GRAPH AND WORD EMBEDDING DISTRIBUTION GRAPH. IN EXTENSIVE EXPERIMENTS ON FSL BENCHMARKS, COMPARED WITH THE BASELINE MODEL, THE ACCURACY OF THE WPGN ON THE 5-WAY-1/2/5 SHOT TASKS INCREASED BY 9.03, 4.56, AND 4.15%, RESPECTIVELY.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
WORD EMBEDDING FOR FRENCH NATURAL LANGUAGE IN HEALTHCARE: A COMPARATIVE STUDY. STRUCTURING RAW MEDICAL DOCUMENTS WITH ONTOLOGY MAPPING IS NOW THE NEXT STEP FOR MEDICAL INTELLIGENCE. DEEP LEARNING MODELS TAKE AS INPUT MATHEMATICALLY EMBEDDED INFORMATION, SUCH AS ENCODED TEXTS. TO DO SO, WORD EMBEDDING METHODS CAN REPRESENT EVERY WORD FROM A TEXT AS A FIXED-LENGTH VECTOR. A FORMAL EVALUATION OF THREE WORD EMBEDDING METHODS HAS BEEN PERFORMED ON RAW MEDICAL DOCUMENTS. THE DATA CORRESPONDS TO MORE THAN 12M DIVERSE DOCUMENTS PRODUCED IN THE ROUEN HOSPITAL (DRUG PRESCRIPTIONS, DISCHARGE AND SURGERY SUMMARIES, INTER-SERVICES LETTERS, ETC.). AUTOMATIC AND MANUAL VALIDATION DEMONSTRATES THAT WORD2VEC BASED ON THE SKIP-GRAM ARCHITECTURE HAD THE BEST RATE ON THREE OUT OF FOUR ACCURACY TESTS. THIS MODEL WILL NOW BE USED AS THE FIRST LAYER OF AN AI-BASED SEMANTIC ANNOTATOR.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
WORD EMBEDDING FOR THE FRENCH NATURAL LANGUAGE IN HEALTH CARE: COMPARATIVE STUDY. BACKGROUND: WORD EMBEDDING TECHNOLOGIES, A SET OF LANGUAGE MODELING AND FEATURE LEARNING TECHNIQUES IN NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP), ARE NOW USED IN A WIDE RANGE OF APPLICATIONS. HOWEVER, NO FORMAL EVALUATION AND COMPARISON HAVE BEEN MADE ON THE ABILITY OF EACH OF THE 3 CURRENT MOST FAMOUS UNSUPERVISED IMPLEMENTATIONS (WORD2VEC, GLOVE, AND FASTTEXT) TO KEEP TRACK OF THE SEMANTIC SIMILARITIES EXISTING BETWEEN WORDS, WHEN TRAINED ON THE SAME DATASET. OBJECTIVE: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO COMPARE EMBEDDING METHODS TRAINED ON A CORPUS OF FRENCH HEALTH-RELATED DOCUMENTS PRODUCED IN A PROFESSIONAL CONTEXT. THE BEST METHOD WILL THEN HELP US DEVELOP A NEW SEMANTIC ANNOTATOR. METHODS: UNSUPERVISED EMBEDDING MODELS HAVE BEEN TRAINED ON 641,279 DOCUMENTS ORIGINATING FROM THE ROUEN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL. THESE DATA ARE NOT STRUCTURED AND COVER A WIDE RANGE OF DOCUMENTS PRODUCED IN A CLINICAL SETTING (DISCHARGE SUMMARY, PROCEDURE REPORTS, AND PRESCRIPTIONS). IN TOTAL, 4 RATED EVALUATION TASKS WERE DEFINED (COSINE SIMILARITY, ODD ONE, ANALOGY-BASED OPERATIONS, AND HUMAN FORMAL EVALUATION) AND APPLIED ON EACH MODEL, AS WELL AS EMBEDDING VISUALIZATION. RESULTS: WORD2VEC HAD THE HIGHEST SCORE ON 3 OUT OF 4 RATED TASKS (ANALOGY-BASED OPERATIONS, ODD ONE SIMILARITY, AND HUMAN VALIDATION), PARTICULARLY REGARDING THE SKIP-GRAM ARCHITECTURE. CONCLUSIONS: ALTHOUGH THIS IMPLEMENTATION HAD THE BEST RATE FOR SEMANTIC PROPERTIES CONSERVATION, EACH MODEL HAS ITS OWN QUALITIES AND DEFECTS, SUCH AS THE TRAINING TIME, WHICH IS VERY SHORT FOR GLOVE, OR MORPHOLOGICAL SIMILARITY CONSERVATION OBSERVED WITH FASTTEXT. MODELS AND TEST SETS PRODUCED BY THIS STUDY WILL BE THE FIRST TO BE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE THROUGH A GRAPHICAL INTERFACE TO HELP ADVANCE THE FRENCH BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
WORD EMBEDDING REVEALS CYFRA 21-1 AS A BIOMARKER FOR CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE. BACKGROUND: ALTHOUGH PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD) EXPERIENCE HIGH MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY WORLDWIDE, FEW BIOMARKERS ARE AVAILABLE FOR COPD. HERE, WE ANALYZED POTENTIAL BIOMARKERS FOR THE DIAGNOSIS OF COPD BY USING WORD EMBEDDING. METHODS: TO DETERMINE WHICH BIOMARKERS ARE LIKELY TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH COPD, WE SELECTED RESPIRATORY DISEASE-RELATED BIOMARKERS. DEGREES OF SIMILARITY BETWEEN THE 26 SELECTED BIOMARKERS AND COPD WERE MEASURED BY WORD EMBEDDING. AND WE INFER THE SIMILARITY WITH COPD THROUGH THE WORD EMBEDDING MODEL TRAINED IN THE LARGE-CAPACITY MEDICAL CORPUS, AND SEARCH FOR BIOMARKERS WITH HIGH SIMILARITY AMONG THEM. WE USED WORD2VEC, CANONICAL CORRELATION ANALYSIS, AND GLOBAL VECTOR FOR WORD EMBEDDING. WE EVALUATED THE ASSOCIATIONS OF SELECTED BIOMARKERS WITH COPD PARAMETERS IN A COHORT OF PATIENTS WITH COPD. RESULTS: CYTOKERATIN 19 FRAGMENT (CYFRA 21-1) WAS SELECTED BECAUSE OF ITS HIGH SIMILARITY AND ITS SIGNIFICANT CORRELATION WITH THE COPD PHENOTYPE. SERUM CYFRA 21-1 LEVELS WERE DETERMINED IN PATIENTS WITH COPD AND CONTROLS (4.3 +/- 5.9 VS. 3.9 +/- 3.6 NG/ML, P = 0.611). THE EMPHYSEMA INDEX WAS SIGNIFICANTLY CORRELATED WITH THE SERUM CYFRA 21-1 LEVEL (CORRELATION COEFFICIENT = 0.219, P = 0.015). CONCLUSION: WORD EMBEDDING MAY BE USED FOR THE DISCOVERY OF BIOMARKERS FOR COPD AND CYFRA 21-1 MAY BE USED AS A BIOMARKER FOR EMPHYSEMA. ADDITIONAL STUDIES ARE NEEDED TO VALIDATE CYFRA 21-1 AS A BIOMARKER FOR COPD.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
WORD EMBEDDINGS AND DEEP LEARNING FOR LOCATION PREDICTION: TRACKING CORONAVIRUS FROM BRITISH AND AMERICAN TWEETS. WITH THE PROPAGATION OF THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC, CURRENT TRENDS ON DETERMINING ITS INDIVIDUAL AND SOCIETAL IMPACTS BECOME INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT. RECENT RESEARCHES GRANT SPECIAL ATTENTION TO THE CORONAVIRUS SOCIAL NETWORKS INFODEMIC TO STUDY SUCH IMPACTS. FOR THIS AIM, WE THINK THAT APPLYING A GEOLOCATION PROCESS IS CRUCIAL BEFORE PROCEEDING TO THE INFODEMIC MANAGEMENT. IN FACT, THE SPREAD OF REPORTED EVENTS AND ACTUALITIES ON SOCIAL NETWORKS MAKES THE IDENTIFICATION OF INFECTED AREAS OR LOCATIONS OF THE INFORMATION OWNERS MORE CHALLENGING ESPECIALLY AT A STATE LEVEL. IN THIS PAPER, WE FOCUS ON LINGUISTIC FEATURES TO ENCODE REGIONAL VARIATIONS FROM SHORT AND NOISY TEXTS SUCH AS TWEETS TO TRACK THIS DISEASE. WE PAY PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO CONTEXTUAL INFORMATION FOR A BETTER ENCODING OF THESE FEATURES. WE REFER TO SOME NEURAL NETWORK-BASED MODELS TO CAPTURE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN WORDS ACCORDING TO THEIR CONTEXTS. BEING EXAMPLES OF THESE MODELS, WE EVALUATE SOME WORD EMBEDDING ONES TO DETERMINE THE MOST EFFECTIVE FEATURES' COMBINATION THAT HAS MORE SPATIAL EVIDENCE. THEN, WE ENSURE A SEQUENTIAL MODELING OF WORDS FOR A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF CONTEXTUAL INFORMATION USING RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORKS. WITHOUT DEFINING RESTRICTED SETS OF LOCAL WORDS IN RELATION TO THE CORONAVIRUS DISEASE, OUR FRAMEWORK CALLED DEEPGEOLOC DEMONSTRATES ITS ABILITY TO GEOLOCATE BOTH TWEETS AND TWITTERERS. IT ALSO MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO CAPTURE GEOSEMANTICS OF NONLOCAL WORDS AND TO DELIMIT THE SPARSE USE OF LOCAL ONES PARTICULARLY IN RETWEETS AND REPORTED EVENTS.

WORD EMBEDDINGS QUANTIFY 100 YEARS OF GENDER AND ETHNIC STEREOTYPES. WORD EMBEDDINGS ARE A POWERFUL MACHINE-LEARNING FRAMEWORK THAT REPRESENTS EACH ENGLISH WORD BY A VECTOR. THE GEOMETRIC RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THESE VECTORS CAPTURES MEANINGFUL SEMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE CORRESPONDING WORDS. IN THIS PAPER, WE DEVELOP A FRAMEWORK TO DEMONSTRATE HOW THE TEMPORAL DYNAMICS OF THE EMBEDDING HELPS TO QUANTIFY CHANGES IN STEREOTYPES AND ATTITUDES TOWARD WOMEN AND ETHNIC MINORITIES IN THE 20TH AND 21ST CENTURIES IN THE UNITED STATES. WE INTEGRATE WORD EMBEDDINGS TRAINED ON 100 Y OF TEXT DATA WITH THE US CENSUS TO SHOW THAT CHANGES IN THE EMBEDDING TRACK CLOSELY WITH DEMOGRAPHIC AND OCCUPATION SHIFTS OVER TIME. THE EMBEDDING CAPTURES SOCIETAL SHIFTS-E.G., THE WOMEN'S MOVEMENT IN THE 1960S AND ASIAN IMMIGRATION INTO THE UNITED STATES-AND ALSO ILLUMINATES HOW SPECIFIC ADJECTIVES AND OCCUPATIONS BECAME MORE CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN POPULATIONS OVER TIME. OUR FRAMEWORK FOR TEMPORAL ANALYSIS OF WORD EMBEDDING OPENS UP A FRUITFUL INTERSECTION BETWEEN MACHINE LEARNING AND QUANTITATIVE SOCIAL SCIENCE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
WORD SENSE DISAMBIGUATION OF MEDICAL TERMS VIA RECURRENT CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS. BACKGROUND: TAGGING TEXT DATA WITH CODES REPRESENTING BIOMEDICAL CONCEPTS PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN MEDICAL DATA MANAGEMENT AND ANALYSIS. A PROBLEM OCCURS IF THERE ARE AMBIGUOUS WORDS LINKED TO SEVERAL CONCEPTS. OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: THIS STUDY AIMS AT INVESTIGATING WORD SENSE DISAMBIGUATION BASED ON WORD EMBEDDING AND RECURRENT CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS. THE STUDY FOCUSES ON TERMS MAPPED TO MULTIPLE CONCEPTS OF THE UNIFIED MEDICAL LANGUAGE SYSTEM (UMLS). RESULTS: WE CREATED 20 TEXT PROCESSING PIPELINES TRAINED ON A SUBSET OF THE MESH WORD SENSE DISAMBIGUATION (MSH WSD) DATA SET, EACH PIPELINE DISAMBIGUATING THE SENSE OF ONE WORD. THE PIPELINES WERE THEN TESTED ON A DISJOINT SUBSET OF MSH WSD DATA. MOST PIPELINES ACHIEVED GOOD OR EVEN EXCELLENT RESULTS (70% OF THE PIPELINES ACHIEVED AT LEAST 90% ACCURACY, 40% ACHIEVED AT LEAST 98% ACCURACY). ONE POOR-PERFORMING OUTLIER WAS DETECTED. CONCLUSION: THE PROPOSED APPROACH CAN SERVE AS A BASIS FOR AN UP-SCALED SYSTEM COMBINING PIPELINES FOR MANY AMBIGUOUS WORDS. THE METHODS USED HERE RECENTLY PROVED VERY SUCCESSFUL IN OTHER FIELDS OF TEXT UNDERSTANDING AND CAN BE EXPECTED TO SCALE-UP WITH IMPROVED AVAILABILITY OF TRAINING DATA.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
WORD SEQUENTIAL USING DEEP LSTM AND MATRIX FACTORIZATION TO HANDLE RATING SPARSE DATA FOR E-COMMERCE RECOMMENDER SYSTEM. RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS ARE ESSENTIAL ENGINES TO DELIVER PRODUCT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR E-COMMERCE BUSINESSES. SUCCESSFUL ADOPTION OF RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCE THE GROWTH OF MARKETING TARGETS. COLLABORATIVE FILTERING IS A TYPE OF RECOMMENDER SYSTEM MODEL THAT USES CUSTOMERS' ACTIVITIES IN THE PAST, SUCH AS RATINGS. UNFORTUNATELY, THE NUMBER OF RATINGS COLLECTED FROM CUSTOMERS IS SPARSE, AMOUNTING TO LESS THAN 4%. THE LATENT FACTOR MODEL IS A KIND OF COLLABORATIVE FILTERING THAT INVOLVES MATRIX FACTORIZATION TO GENERATE RATING PREDICTIONS. HOWEVER, USING ONLY MATRIX FACTORIZATION WOULD RESULT IN AN INACCURATE RECOMMENDATION. SEVERAL MODELS INCLUDE PRODUCT REVIEW DOCUMENTS TO INCREASE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THEIR RATING PREDICTION. MOST OF THEM USE METHODS SUCH AS TF-IDF AND LDA TO INTERPRET PRODUCT REVIEW DOCUMENTS. HOWEVER, TRADITIONAL MODELS SUCH AS LDA AND TF-IDF FACE SOME SHORTCOMINGS, IN THAT THEY SHOW A LESS CONTEXTUAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE DOCUMENT. THIS RESEARCH INTEGRATED MATRIX FACTORIZATION AND NOVEL MODELS TO INTERPRET AND UNDERSTAND PRODUCT REVIEW DOCUMENTS USING LSTM AND WORD EMBEDDING. ACCORDING TO THE EXPERIMENT REPORT, THIS MODEL SIGNIFICANTLY OUTPERFORMED THE TRADITIONAL LATENT FACTOR MODEL BY MORE THAN 16% ON AN AVERAGE AND ACHIEVED 1% ON AN AVERAGE BASED ON RMSE EVALUATION METRICS, COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUS BEST PERFORMANCE. CONTEXTUAL INSIGHT OF THE PRODUCT REVIEW DOCUMENT IS AN IMPORTANT ASPECT TO IMPROVE PERFORMANCE IN A SPARSE RATING MATRIX. IN THE FUTURE WORK, GENERATING CONTEXTUAL INSIGHT USING BIDIRECTIONAL WORD SEQUENTIAL IS REQUIRED TO INCREASE THE PERFORMANCE OF E-COMMERCE RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS WITH SPARSE DATA ISSUES.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
WORD2VEC CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS FOR CLASSIFICATION OF NEWS ARTICLES AND TWEETS. BIG WEB DATA FROM SOURCES INCLUDING ONLINE NEWS AND TWITTER ARE GOOD RESOURCES FOR INVESTIGATING DEEP LEARNING. HOWEVER, COLLECTED NEWS ARTICLES AND TWEETS ALMOST CERTAINLY CONTAIN DATA UNNECESSARY FOR LEARNING, AND THIS DISTURBS ACCURATE LEARNING. THIS PAPER EXPLORES THE PERFORMANCE OF WORD2VEC CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS (CNNS) TO CLASSIFY NEWS ARTICLES AND TWEETS INTO RELATED AND UNRELATED ONES. USING TWO WORD EMBEDDING ALGORITHMS OF WORD2VEC, CONTINUOUS BAG-OF-WORD (CBOW) AND SKIP-GRAM, WE CONSTRUCTED CNN WITH THE CBOW MODEL AND CNN WITH THE SKIP-GRAM MODEL. WE MEASURED THE CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY OF CNN WITH CBOW, CNN WITH SKIP-GRAM, AND CNN WITHOUT WORD2VEC MODELS FOR REAL NEWS ARTICLES AND TWEETS. THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS INDICATED THAT WORD2VEC SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED THE ACCURACY OF THE CLASSIFICATION MODEL. THE ACCURACY OF THE CBOW MODEL WAS HIGHER AND MORE STABLE WHEN COMPARED TO THAT OF THE SKIP-GRAM MODEL. THE CBOW MODEL EXHIBITED BETTER PERFORMANCE ON NEWS ARTICLES, AND THE SKIP-GRAM MODEL EXHIBITED BETTER PERFORMANCE ON TWEETS. SPECIFICALLY, CNN WITH WORD2VEC MODELS WAS MORE EFFECTIVE ON NEWS ARTICLES WHEN COMPARED TO THAT ON TWEETS BECAUSE NEWS ARTICLES ARE TYPICALLY MORE UNIFORM WHEN COMPARED TO TWEETS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
WORD2VEC NEURAL MODEL-BASED TECHNIQUETO GENERATE PROTEIN VECTORS FOR COMBATING COVID-19: A MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH. THE WORLD WAS AMBUSHED IN 2019 BY THE COVID-19 VIRUS WHICH AFFECTED THE HEALTH, ECONOMY, AND LIFESTYLE OF INDIVIDUALS WORLDWIDE. ONE WAY OF COMBATING SUCH A PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERN IS BY USING APPROPRIATE, RAPID, AND UNBIASED DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS FOR QUICK DETECTION OF INFECTED PEOPLE. HOWEVER, A CURRENT DEARTH OF BIOINFORMATICS TOOLS NECESSITATES MODELING STUDIES TO HELP DIAGNOSE COVID-19 CASES. MOLECULAR-BASED METHODS SUCH AS THE REAL-TIME REVERSE TRANSCRIPTION POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION (RRT-PCR) FOR DETECTING COVID-19 IS TIME CONSUMING AND PRONE TO CONTAMINATION. MODERN BIOINFORMATICS TOOLS HAVE MADE IT POSSIBLE TO CREATE LARGE DATABASES OF PROTEIN SEQUENCES OF VARIOUS DISEASES, APPLY DATA MINING TECHNIQUES, AND ACCURATELY DIAGNOSE DISEASES. HOWEVER, THE CURRENT SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT TOOLS THAT USE THESE DATABASES ARE NOT ABLE TO DETECT NOVEL COVID-19 VIRAL SEQUENCES DUE TO HIGH SEQUENCE DISSIMILARITY. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY, THEREFORE, WAS TO DEVELOP MODELS THAT CAN ACCURATELY CLASSIFY COVID-19 VIRAL SEQUENCES RAPIDLY USING PROTEIN VECTORS GENERATED BY NEURAL WORD EMBEDDING TECHNIQUE. FIVE MACHINE LEARNING MODELS; K NEAREST NEIGHBOR REGRESSION (KNN), SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE (SVM), RANDOM FOREST (RF), LINEAR DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS (LDA), AND LOGISTIC REGRESSION WERE DEVELOPED USING DATASETS FROM THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR BIOTECHNOLOGY. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST, THE RF MODEL PERFORMED BETTER THAN ALL OTHER MODELS ON THE TRAINING DATASET WITH 99% ACCURACY SCORE AND 99.5% ACCURACY ON THE TESTING DATASET. THE IMPLICATION OF THIS STUDY IS THAT, RAPID DETECTION OF THE COVID-19 VIRUS IN SUSPECTED CASES COULD POTENTIALLY SAVE LIVES AS LESS TIME WILL BE NEEDED TO ASCERTAIN THE STATUS OF A PATIENT.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
WORD2VEC SKIP-GRAM DIMENSIONALITY SELECTION VIA SEQUENTIAL NORMALIZED MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD. IN THIS PAPER, WE PROPOSE A NOVEL INFORMATION CRITERIA-BASED APPROACH TO SELECT THE DIMENSIONALITY OF THE WORD2VEC SKIP-GRAM (SG). FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE PROBABILITY THEORY, SG IS CONSIDERED AS AN IMPLICIT PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION ESTIMATION UNDER THE ASSUMPTION THAT THERE EXISTS A TRUE CONTEXTUAL DISTRIBUTION AMONG WORDS. THEREFORE, WE APPLY INFORMATION CRITERIA WITH THE AIM OF SELECTING THE BEST DIMENSIONALITY SO THAT THE CORRESPONDING MODEL CAN BE AS CLOSE AS POSSIBLE TO THE TRUE DISTRIBUTION. WE EXAMINE THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION CRITERIA FOR THE DIMENSIONALITY SELECTION PROBLEM: THE AKAIKE'S INFORMATION CRITERION (AIC), BAYESIAN INFORMATION CRITERION (BIC), AND SEQUENTIAL NORMALIZED MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD (SNML) CRITERION. SNML IS THE TOTAL CODELENGTH REQUIRED FOR THE SEQUENTIAL ENCODING OF A DATA SEQUENCE ON THE BASIS OF THE MINIMUM DESCRIPTION LENGTH. THE PROPOSED APPROACH IS APPLIED TO BOTH THE ORIGINAL SG MODEL AND THE SG NEGATIVE SAMPLING MODEL TO CLARIFY THE IDEA OF USING INFORMATION CRITERIA. ADDITIONALLY, AS THE ORIGINAL SNML SUFFERS FROM COMPUTATIONAL DISADVANTAGES, WE INTRODUCE NOVEL HEURISTICS FOR ITS EFFICIENT COMPUTATION. MOREOVER, WE EMPIRICALLY DEMONSTRATE THAT SNML OUTPERFORMS BOTH BIC AND AIC. IN COMPARISON WITH OTHER EVALUATION METHODS FOR WORD EMBEDDING, THE DIMENSIONALITY SELECTED BY SNML IS SIGNIFICANTLY CLOSER TO THE OPTIMAL DIMENSIONALITY OBTAINED BY WORD ANALOGY OR WORD SIMILARITY TASKS.
